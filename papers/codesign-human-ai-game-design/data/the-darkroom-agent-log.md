# Agent Development Log

Project Title: **The Darkroom** — a 2D puzzle-platformer where you don't move through the world, you *develop* it like a photograph
Student / Team: Boyan Peng (GitHub: King-Raphael)
Original Life Experience: Developing photographs in a darkroom — under the safelight, an image only exists where light has touched the paper
Core Emotion: The fragile trust that what you stand on only exists while it is lit — caution first, then mastery
Core Mechanic: Switching between three exposure states (Under / Normal / Over) changes what is solid; holding the shutter draws long-exposure light strokes that become temporary terrain
Current Game Idea: One continuous 11-room level (~20 min first playthrough), each room teaching one idea then recombining them; every cost is also a tool somewhere
Current Graph / Data Structure Summary: Entire level generated at runtime from `LevelData` (11 `RoomDef` tables of boxes/enemies/sensors/doors/pickups/checkpoints/hints/exit); event-driven `ExposureManager` applies a solidity matrix to registered `ExposureObject`s; `TrailSystem` keeps a 3-stroke budget of `TrailStroke` line colliders; zero external assets — all art, audio and lighting are procedural
AI Agent Used: Claude Code (model: Claude Fable 5)
Development Period: 2026-06-10 → ongoing

*Convention: Raw Interaction Logs are appended automatically after every meaningful development conversation; Reflection Logs are generated only when the student asks for one. Entries are chronological.*

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 01 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-10 evening → 2026-06-11 00:09
**Development Stage:** Project setup & core systems (Milestone 1)
**Current Goal:** Build a playable demo from the provided build spec

### Student Prompt
Provided `the_darkroom_spec_v2.md` (a complete build spec: physics contract, solidity matrix, all scripts, 11-room coordinate tables) and asked: "根据这个 markdown 内容开始构建游戏，可以先做一个 demo，然后逐步丰富玩法，美术，设置等" (build the game from this markdown; make a demo first, then progressively enrich gameplay, art and settings).

### Agent Response Summary
Explored the existing Unity project (6000.4.7f1, URP 2D template, **new Input System only** — legacy `Input.GetKey` unavailable), then planned three milestones. Implemented the whole codebase as runtime-generated with zero scene wiring: a `Bootstrap` entry point builds managers, camera, HUD, level and player in any scene. Set custom physics layers, wrote 23 C# scripts (exposure system with jam rule, player controller with coyote time/jump buffering, stroke drawing/fixing, enemies as statue-platforms, sensors/doors, film-strip HUD), plus an editor validator that checks the level data against the spec tables. Built a three-tier verification pipeline: offline `csc` compile against Unity DLLs, Unity batchmode compile, and the data validator.

### Development Action
Created the entire initial codebase; ran a 14-agent specification audit on its own first-pass code, which found **9 real issues — 2 major** (the jam rule false-positived on strokes drawn along the ground; `PhotoSensor` silently missed activation because a still player's Rigidbody2D falls asleep and stops `OnTriggerStay2D`). All were fixed before the first commit.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Assets/Scripts/**` (Core/Player/World/UI/Level/Editor — 23 files), `Level01.unity`, layers in `TagManager.asset`, `EditorBuildSettings.asset`, `README.md`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `a12e861` (M1 demo, rooms 0–2). Compile clean, validator green (101 level objects matching the spec).

### Student Follow-up
Accepted the generated codebase on the strength of the automated checks and own playtesting rather than line-by-line code review; proceeded to the full game.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 02 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 00:10
**Development Stage:** Full game (Milestones 2–3)
**Current Goal:** Enable all 11 rooms and first polish

### Student Prompt
(Continuation of the same request — demo first, then the full game.)

### Agent Response Summary
Flipped `Bootstrap.BuildThroughRoomCount` from 2 to 10, enabling rooms 3–10 (strokes, sensors/doors, the Room 9 drop, the finale). Added the spec §9 polish touch: the camera background lerps from `#121212` to a faint warm `#1A1414` as x increases — the print "developing" toward the exit.

### Development Action
Configuration flip + small camera feature.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Bootstrap.cs`, `CameraFollow.cs`, `VisualFactory.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Commits `d46bdf7` (M2) and `24a6b44` (M3). Validator PASS on the full build.

### Student Follow-up
Opened the project in the Unity editor and started playtesting (asked one environment question about Unity's "Scene(s) Have Been Modified" dialog — answered: Don't Save, the Untitled scene was empty).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 03 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 00:21
**Development Stage:** Documentation
**Current Goal:** Chinese player-facing walkthrough

### Student Prompt
"给我写一个中文版的通关说明" (write a Chinese walkthrough).

### Agent Response Summary
Wrote `Assets/通关说明.md`: controls and hand position, exposure rules quick-reference, stroke rules, room-by-room solutions checked against the actual `LevelData` coordinates (statue parking position in Room 7, arc clearance in Room 5, etc.), death/respawn rules, and a FAQ for common stuck states.

### Development Action
Created player documentation.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Assets/通关说明.md` (+ meta).

### Immediate Result
Commit `2a8c7ad`.

### Student Follow-up
Used the walkthrough while playtesting — which immediately exposed a real problem (next entry).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 04 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 00:32
**Development Stage:** Playtest-driven bug fixing
**Current Goal:** Make the Room 3 stroke-climb actually doable

### Student Prompt
Bug report from playtesting Room 3: "在跳跃最高点松开…踩上去，也跳不上方块顶啊，太远了" (following the guide — release at the jump apex, stand on the stroke — you still can't reach the block top; it's too far).

### Agent Response Summary
The student was right and **the agent's own walkthrough advice was wrong**. Math check: jump apex ≈ 3.0 (feet), but a stroke fixed at the apex sat only ~0.05 below the next jump's maximum — effectively unreachable; and a "point" stroke released at the apex was tiny and often too far from the block. Two fixes: (1) code — strokes now draw 0.25 below the feet instead of 0.10, so an apex-drawn stroke is comfortably reachable; (2) technique — the guide now teaches "draw an arch *through* the apex, not a point *at* it" (hold Shift across the top of the arc, enter at the arch's low end, walk/hop up).

### Development Action
Tuned a gameplay constant; rewrote the walkthrough technique for Rooms 3 and 4.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`TrailSystem.cs` (FeetOffset 0.10 → 0.25), `README.md`, `通关说明.md`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `1c337ed`. Student confirmed Room 3 now works.

### Student Follow-up
"挺好的，开始继续丰富和下一步" — approved, asked to continue enriching.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 05 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 00:47
**Development Stage:** Stretch goals (Milestone 4)
**Current Goal:** All five spec §16 stretch goals, still zero assets

### Student Prompt
"没问题，开始继续丰富和下一步" (continue enriching; next steps).

### Agent Response Summary
Implemented every stretch goal in the spec's priority order: (1) procedurally synthesized audio — hand-written waveforms for the shutter click, a seamless 55 Hz hum loop in Under, a hiss loop in Over, the jam thud, pickup chime, win shutter; (2) sparkle particles along strokes while drawing; (3) a flickering film-grain overlay; (4) a statue "crackle" flicker when an enemy freezes; (5) a replay timer hidden until the first win.

### Development Action
New `AudioDirector` and `StrokeSparkle` systems; HUD and enemy additions.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`AudioDirector.cs` (new), `StrokeSparkle.cs` (new), `HUDController.cs`, `LightSensitiveEnemy.cs`, `GameManager.cs`, `WinScreen.cs`, `TrailSystem.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `36feabc` (after removing accidentally committed `.idea/` files — the IDE config had slipped into the first attempt and was amended out).

### Student Follow-up
"都不错" — approved; asked what the next round should be ("美术设计?").

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 06 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 00:57
**Development Stage:** Art pass (Milestone 5)
**Current Goal:** Replace color blocks with procedural pixel art

### Student Prompt
Confirmed the art-design round.

### Agent Response Summary
Built a `PixelArt` factory (sprites authored as in-code string maps; world tiles generated by rule). Player became a pixel figure with a 2-frame walk, jump pose, facing flip and landing squash (visuals on a child object so the collider never scales); enemies got closed/glowing-red-eye sprites and a breathing idle; world surfaces switched to tiled textures (stone-block ground, star-flecked dark paths, light-streak barriers, slat doors); pickups became a flash bulb and a tiny camera; the exit became a framed red door. The jam-check bounds had to be refactored (explicit box sizes instead of `lossyScale`) because tiled sprites keep scale at 1.

### Development Action
Art system + visual refactor across the builder, player and enemy.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`PixelArt.cs` (new), `PlayerAnimator.cs` (new), `LevelBuilder.cs`, `PlayerController.cs`, `LightSensitiveEnemy.cs`, `ExposureObject.cs`, `AbilityPickup.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `83f1616`. Compile clean; counts unchanged.

### Student Follow-up
Asked for a more complete version, directly ("能直接做的完整版一点吗").

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 07 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 01:06
**Development Stage:** Atmosphere (Milestone 6)
**Current Goal:** The "complete edition" — ambience and wayfinding

### Student Prompt
"都不错，能直接做的完整版一点吗" (all good — go ahead and make it more complete).

### Agent Response Summary
Added a two-speed parallax backdrop of darkroom silhouettes (hanging photo lines with clips, shelves with bottles, enlargers — procedurally placed); glow halos on dark paths and strokes whose alpha follows the solidity matrix; a pulsing safelight halo on the exit; a radial vignette in Under; checkpoint markers as small hanging photos that brighten once "developed"; and a fading "THE DARKROOM" title card at boot.

### Development Action
Atmosphere layer built; glow plumbing added to the exposure system (`OnAlphaApplied` hook).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`BackdropBuilder.cs`, `ParallaxLayer.cs`, `GlowPulse.cs` (new), `ExposureObject.cs`, `TrailStroke.cs`, `LevelBuilder.cs`, `HUDController.cs`, `WinScreen.cs`, `Checkpoint.cs`, `PixelArt.cs`, `Bootstrap.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `d68078b`.

### Student Follow-up
Asked for a truly premium version that fits the photography style.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 08 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 01:18
**Development Stage:** Premium pass (Milestone 7)
**Current Goal:** Real lighting — make light the literal medium

### Student Prompt
"可以出一个制作很精美的版本吗，符合这个摄影的风格" (make a finely crafted version that fits the photography style).

### Agent Response Summary
Switched from fake darkness (screen overlay) to **real URP 2D lighting**: a global light follows the exposure (neutral 1.0 / cold dim 0.30 in Under / blown warm 1.35 in Over); world geometry uses a lit material while things that *are* light (dark paths, strokes, halos, pickups) render unlit; ~20 point lights placed where light should be — the pen tip while drawing, dark paths (intensity follows the matrix), a pulsing red light at the exit, red glow on awake enemies, the player's own faint lamp so Under is never fully blind. Also upsized the player to a 14×26 photographer (hair, scarf, coat, camera with cyan lens), gave the HUD film-strip a backing with sprocket holes, and added a contact-sheet caption to the win screen.

### Development Action
Lighting architecture + sprite/HUD refinement; screen overlay reduced to a thin tint.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LightDirector.cs` (new), `VisualFactory.cs` (lit/unlit material split), `LevelBuilder.cs`, `TrailStroke.cs`, `PlayerController.cs`, `PlayerAnimator.cs`, `LightSensitiveEnemy.cs`, `PhotoSensor.cs`, `GlowPulse.cs`, `HUDController.cs`, `WinScreen.cs`, `Bootstrap.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `7b589d9`. One API deprecation caught by the offline compile (`FindObjectsSortMode`) and fixed.

### Student Follow-up
"可以的" — and asked what a truly complete, polished game still needs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 09 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 10:40
**Development Stage:** Finishing pass (Milestone 8)
**Current Goal:** Close the gaps to a finished product

### Student Prompt
"距离一个很精美完整的游戏来看应该还加什么" (what does it still need to be a polished, complete game). When asked to choose: **accepted** Esc pause + M mute; **rejected** bilingual hints (kept pure English); **deferred** building/distribution. Then **rejected the agent's first plan** with an extra requirement: "二连跳那儿可以难一点，现在其实画一个轨迹就能跳上去" — the Room 4 "two-stroke" climb was actually passable with a single stroke.

### Agent Response Summary
Gap analysis identified: no death/respawn feedback, thin soundscape, static air, no pause. On the Room 4 complaint, the agent verified the student's math was right (single-stroke launch ~5.8 → apex ~8.3 > the 7.5 ledge — the spec's own numbers never required two strokes). The agent first explored forcing two strokes with ceilings/baffles, and **discarded those designs** (fixed jump energy defeats them or they block the intended path too); the clean fix was raising the ledge to 9.0 (above the one-stroke ceiling of 8.3) and moving Room 5's entry up 1.5 in lockstep. M8 then delivered: themed death ("the image burns" — grain burst) and respawn ("re-develops" — alpha/scale ease-in), nine new synthesized sounds (footsteps, jump, land, death, develop, checkpoint, door rumble, drawing crackle, room tone), drifting dust motes, stroke end-tapering, Esc pause + M mute.

### Development Action
Feedback systems, soundscape, pause; data-level difficulty fix.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`PauseController.cs`, `DustMotes.cs` (new), `AudioDirector.cs`, `GameManager.cs`, `PlayerAnimator.cs`, `StrokeSparkle.cs`, `TrailSystem.cs`, `TrailStroke.cs`, `PlayerController.cs`, `SensorDoor.cs`, `HUDController.cs`, `DarkroomInput.cs`, `Bootstrap.cs`, `LevelData.cs` (R4 ledge → 9.0; R5 gate/ceiling/checkpoint/hint +1.5).

### Immediate Result
Commit `5061a27`. Validator PASS (editor happened to be closed, so the full batchmode check ran).

### Student Follow-up
Reported one more skippable lesson (next entry).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 10 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 10:45
**Development Stage:** Playtest-driven level fixing
**Current Goal:** Make Room 1's lesson unskippable

### Student Prompt
"第一关教学的时候三级暗色台阶，实际上可以直接跳过去，把三个台阶做的宽一点" (the three dark steps in the first teaching room can simply be jumped over; make the steps wider).

### Agent Response Summary
Verified: a running jump covers ~5.6 units (~6.3 with coyote time) and the spec's gap was only 4.5 — the room's single lesson ("press 1") could be skipped entirely. Fix combined the student's request with the root cause: gap widened to 7.5 (beyond the jump limit), the three steps widened 1.0 → 1.6 with 0.25–0.7 hop gaps — the taught route became *easier* while the skip became impossible. The agent also swept the other rooms for the same class of exploit (Rooms 6/7 climb targets are above the bare-jump apex; Room 4 fixed previously — no others found).

### Development Action
Level-data geometry fix.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (R1 steps + landing), `README.md`.

### Immediate Result
Commit `9bf130c`. All three student-discovered design flaws (Room 3 too tight, Room 4 too loose, Room 1 skippable) closed.

### Student Follow-up
Moved on to publishing the project.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 11 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 11:38
**Development Stage:** Publishing
**Current Goal:** Push the project to GitHub and produce a repository link

### Student Prompt
"Please push your Unity project to GitHub… 整个文件夹是在我 github里的…都还没有 push 到github过" (the repo exists but nothing was ever pushed).

### Agent Response Summary
This step had real friction, recorded honestly: the machine had **no usable Git credentials** (no keychain entry, no SSH key, `gh` CLI not installed). Two attempts at the OAuth device-code flow stalled — first the interactive `gh auth login` prompts could not be automated (the TUI waits on terminal control sequences), then the raw device-flow code (`92EA-9A01`) confused the student, who expected to *receive* a code rather than *enter* the displayed one; the browser then hit GitHub's "Confirm access" 2FA wall. Resolution: a screenshot of the desktop revealed **GitHub Desktop was already signed in with the repository added** — the agent triggered its Push command directly, and all 11 pending commits went up at once.

### Development Action
Repository published; project-local `.gitignore` had been added earlier so Unity caches and sibling projects stay out.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
None (infrastructure only).

### Immediate Result
Remote `main` = local `main` (`9bf130c`). Repository: https://github.com/King-Raphael/26SM_Demo (game under `Assignment3/The Darkroom`).

### Student Follow-up
Warned by the agent not to press GitHub Desktop's "Commit 157676 files" button (untracked sibling projects). Next: the professor's development-log requirement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 12 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 ~12:00
**Development Stage:** Course documentation
**Current Goal:** Create this development log and keep it maintained

### Student Prompt
Forwarded the professor's "Generate Development Log Prompt" PDF: the agent must maintain `agent-development-log.md` — Raw Interaction Logs appended automatically after meaningful development conversations, Reflection Logs only on request, chronological, honest about misunderstandings and rejected suggestions — and push it to GitHub.

### Agent Response Summary
Created this file, reconstructing all prior interactions from the session history and git timestamps, including the unflattering parts (the agent's wrong Room 3 technique advice, the audit finding 9 bugs in its own first-pass code, the rejected first M8 plan, the GitHub auth confusion). Saved the logging convention to the agent's persistent memory so future sessions keep appending entries in this format.

### Development Action
Created course documentation; established the ongoing logging convention.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`agent-development-log.md` (this file).

### Immediate Result
Committed and pushed to GitHub alongside the project.

### Student Follow-up
(Pending — say "reflect on this stage" any time to generate the first Reflection Log.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 13 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 ~13:00
**Development Stage:** Cinematic art-direction overhaul (Milestone 9)
**Current Goal:** Replace the pixel-art look with the student's concept-art style

### Student Prompt
Provided three concept mockups (camera-viewfinder UI with exposure slider and REC, soft silhouette girl, industrial darkroom under hanging lamp light-pools, ribbon-like light trails, sepia overexposure): "这三张是我之前做的示意图，我希望做成这样的风格而不是单纯的像素风". After reviewing the agent's first plan, the student **rejected it with four revisions**: REC/viewfinder should appear only while drawing; control hints and the exposure card should exist only during the opening tutorial; external polished assets are now allowed (not everything procedural); Room 6's sensor could be skipped entirely; and the opening should introduce abilities one at a time (Under first, then Over).

### Agent Response Summary
Re-planned per the revisions, then implemented: a full camera-UI rebuild (monospace font via OS Menlo with bundled-font priority, exposure slider + state badge replacing the spec's film-strip HUD, room title + objectives, progressive control hints that retire after Room 3, tutorial-only exposure card, world-anchored hint bubbles, viewfinder corners + blinking REC gated on the shutter being open); a new **Negative** pickup so Underexposed itself is locked at start (tutorial chain: move → negative → flash → shutter); soft silhouette characters drawn from shapes (`SilhouetteArt`, bilinear — girl with glowing eye, shadow-blob enemies); environment restyle (value-noise concrete/brick, catch-light platform edges, hanging cone lamps with real light pools, fog-glass barriers, lens-panel doors, glowing white exit doorway); soft-glow particles everywhere; cinematic grading (Normal 0.75 cool, Under 0.22 cold, Over warm sepia 1.25). Verified the Room 6 skip mathematically (spec ceiling top 6.6 flush with the 6.55 anchor) and fixed it by raising the door to y 3.5–8.0 with the ceiling at 8.2–8.6 spanning the anchor; noted that extreme 3-stroke stacking remains as accepted speedrun tech.

### Development Action
Major presentation refactor (~15 files), new ability gate, level-geometry fix, validator updated (3 pickups, room titles).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`HUDController.cs` (rewritten), `FontLoader.cs`, `SilhouetteArt.cs` (new), `PixelArt.cs` (noise tiles, lamp cone, disc/soft-glow), `LevelData.cs` (titles/objectives, Negative pickup, R6 door), `LevelBuilder.cs`, `BackdropBuilder.cs` (lamps), `ExposureManager.cs`, `GameManager.cs`, `AbilityPickup.cs`, `PlayerAnimator.cs`, `LightSensitiveEnemy.cs`, `SensorDoor.cs`, `TrailSystem.cs`, `TrailStroke.cs`, `StrokeSparkle.cs`, `LightDirector.cs`, `VisualFactory.cs`, `DarkroomValidator.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Offline compile clean. Awaiting the student's visual check against the mockups (lighting/readability constants may need tuning); external CC0 assets (font/textures/glow sprites) offered as a follow-up pending download approval.

### Student Follow-up
Playtested with two screenshots and gave precise visual notes (next entry).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 14 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 ~14:10
**Development Stage:** Visual tuning from playtest screenshots (M9.1)
**Current Goal:** Act on the student's screenshot review of the restyle

### Student Prompt
Two in-game screenshots with notes: Normal is a bit too dark; the UI is too busy; external assets are approved ("外部素材都可以加入"); the backdrop is too monotonous; walls/paths/enemies deserve better styles; the film grain in Under/Normal is far too heavy.

### Agent Response Summary
Lighting: Normal global 0.75 → 0.95, lamp lights 0.5/4.2 → 0.6/5.0. Grain: alpha 0.05 → 0.022, sparser/softer (bilinear, larger tiling, slower flicker). UI declutter: removed the state badge box (the highlighted slider label + tutorial card carry it), objectives now peek for 6 s on room entry then fade, control hints shrunk to 17 px at 65% alpha with condensed wording. External assets integrated with the student's approval: JetBrains Mono (OFL) bundled as the UI font, Poly Haven CC0 concrete/brick 1K textures loaded from StreamingAssets at runtime with procedural fallbacks (photo textures tinted down; procedural tiles re-baked brighter to match). DarkPath restyled from noise tiles to a stretched glowing energy band (bright core, soft falloff). Enemy silhouette redrawn: crouched shade with horn nubs, flat bottom, and a dim red aura + bright eyes when awake. Backdrop enriched: near-black brick patches plus pipes with brackets and elbows, crate stacks, chains, barrels, at higher density.

### Development Action
Visual tuning pass + first external assets (font, two textures) with credits in README.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LightDirector.cs`, `HUDController.cs`, `PixelArt.cs` (LoadExternal, DarkPath band, brighter fallbacks), `LevelBuilder.cs` (DarkPath band rig, ground tinting), `SilhouetteArt.cs` (enemy), `BackdropBuilder.cs` (new prop types), `README.md` (credits), `Assets/Resources/Fonts/Mono.ttf`, `Assets/StreamingAssets/{concrete,bricks}.jpg`.

### Immediate Result
Offline compile clean; pushed for the student's next visual check.

### Student Follow-up
(Pending playtest.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 15 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-11 ~15:00
**Development Stage:** Narrative & dramatic-presentation uplift (Milestone 10 "叙事成像")
**Current Goal:** Fix the student's diagnosis that the game "还是略微平淡" (still a bit flat)

### Student Prompt
"考虑一下游戏设计 以及 storytelling 怎么进一步提升，现在还是略微平淡了" — asked for design thinking, not a prescribed change list.

### Agent Response Summary
Ran a three-agent codebase audit (mechanics map / narrative inventory / design-intent history), then a 7-agent design workflow: three proposal lenses (narrative, set-piece, systems), each adversarially critiqued, then synthesized into nested S/M/L packages. Diagnosis accepted by the student: the mechanics are not flat — the narrative layer is (all 18 hints purely instructional, no motivation, no pacing contrast, the win caption "frame 11 of 11" a hook nothing leads to). The student approved the story spine — **the run is one eleven-frame roll of film, and frame 11 is a self-portrait: the photograph no photographer can take** — and the full "大包" scope. 13 seductive ideas were explicitly rejected with reasons recorded (collectible system, lore ghosts in the backdrop, TRAILS→ROLL rename, "it took you." pun, 13-caption flood, 20-minute bass arc, etc.).

Implemented all 14 items: **S1** FRAME N OF 11 room titles + "one roll. eleven frames." title-card line + R1 hint rewrite ("the path was never printed"); **S2** death-cause margin notes ("the print burned. the negative survives." once, then "BURNED — too much light." / "OUT OF FRAME."; R stays silent) + one-time physical-jam note ("nothing develops where you stand."); **S3** red-eye hint rewrites making the statues her photo subjects; **S4** win-screen self-portrait on warm photo paper + dynamic "take N." caption from the death counter; **M1** delayed title drop (THE DARKROOM surfaces 1.35 s after the first press of 1 — the world's first real darkness — with the white pop suppressed and the under-hum leaned on); **M2** five late-game checkpoint captions planting the blank eleventh frame ("frame 11 — unexposed." / "still unexposed."); **M3** the Room 9 corridor blackout — fall wind + camera lag, lamps die 0.8 s after touchdown, exposure input locked (incl. E/Q) with jam-shake feedback, ambience ducked to near-silence through a new single-owner duck factor, footsteps boosted, three non-colliding prop shades whose eye slits glint as she passes, relight + bare shutter click at the stairs, 25 s fuse and a respawn abort path written first; **M4** staged win sequence (flash → frame → strip → portrait develops over 1.9 s with a new long develop swell → margin lines → DEVELOPED block); **M5** film-advance ratchet + HUD jolt when the 4th stroke winds the oldest away; **L1** PhotoAlbum — each room's first checkpoint silently photographs the player's own run (SubmitRenderRequest with targetTexture fallback and black-frame validation; +25% lift for Under shots), the win screen develops the 11 thumbnails along the film bar with frame numbers on the print margins; **L2** the finale — the exit no longer hard-cuts: RunTime freezes, the guard is frozen gray, she turns to face the world, the journey arrives as accelerating shutter clicks, warm light sweeps with the exit lamp flaring, viewfinder + double-time REC + three 900 Hz beeps, she raises the camera (new GirlShoot pose with a pose-lock in PlayerAnimator), frame 11 is captured by her own hand, then Win(); **L3** a near-subliminal pedal throb (82/82.5/164 Hz seamless 2 s loop) rising through Room 10 and cutting to dead silence at the finale; **L4** asleep statues part their lids a sliver while stood on (IsStandingOn, not proximity); **L5** room titles develop in with a two-frame grain flicker.

A 22-agent adversarial review of the diff (3 dimensions × refutation verifiers) confirmed 7 real issues, all fixed before commit: a **blocker** (any death anywhere permanently disarmed the blackout — the OnRespawn abort needed an "armed and untouched" early-return, plus mid-fall deaths now re-arm the wind), a missed frame (CP_R5 sits 1 unit left of Room 5's boundary, so x-derived room indexing filed its photo under Room 4 — the builder now passes the authoritative room index), the contact strip occluding the caption (slot pivot math), the relocated R9 hint still popping 0.5 units before the relight (moved to x=141.6, relight pulled to 138.5), the finale lamp flare leaking across FullRestart (originals recorded and restored), `_jamNoteShown` not reset per-run, and a stale comment. Six other findings were refuted by the verifiers (e.g. a suspected Kill()/finale race — IsCinematic already gates the kill checks).

### Development Action
14-feature narrative/presentation milestone + 2 new systems (ScriptedBlackout, PhotoAlbum), audio bed refactor to single-owner ducking, finale state machine, adversarial review pass.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`GameManager.cs` (DeathCause, Deaths counter, BeginFinale/IsCinematic, lamp flare+restore), `ScriptedBlackout.cs` (new), `PhotoAlbum.cs` (new), `ExposureManager.cs` (Locked, silent ForceSet, physical-jam distinction), `AudioDirector.cs` (duck factor, wind, pedal, film advance, beeps, finale chord/bursts, long develop), `LightDirector.cs` (override), `CameraFollow.cs` (LagScale), `HUDController.cs` (frame counter, death/jam notes, checkpoint captions, title drop, REC fast, title develop-in), `WinScreen.cs` (staged sequence, self-portrait, contact strip, dynamic caption), `LevelData.cs` (caption field, hint rewrites/move), `LevelBuilder.cs` (caption/room threading, blackout spawn), `Checkpoint.cs`, `LevelExit.cs`, `TrailSystem.cs`, `LightSensitiveEnemy.cs` (stood-on glints), `PlayerAnimator.cs` (pose lock), `SilhouetteArt.cs` (GirlShoot), `Bootstrap.cs`.

### Immediate Result
Offline compile clean (compile command extended with URP/Audio/ImageConversion refs — the old short form no longer covers the codebase). Batchmode validator not run (Editor holds the project lock); `.meta` files for the two new scripts hand-authored in the repo's minimal format. The Cinemachine package addition found in `Packages/manifest.json` is the student's own Editor-side change and was left out of this commit.

### Student Follow-up
(Pending playtest — the five gates that need human eyes: ① R0–R2: FRAME 1 OF 11 fits the title box, title drop lands on the first press of 1 with ≤2 text planes alive; ② CP_R10 captions plant the "blank frame 11" idea; ③ the blackout: try R, E/Q and dying in the dark — lights/locks/ambience must restore atomically, and "the slider refusing" must read as intentional, not a bug; ④ the win screen: thumbnails legible (esp. Under rooms), nothing overlapping at 1920×1080; ⑤ a full 20-minute run, ideally by someone who hasn't played.)

## Interaction 16 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~13:45
**Development Stage:** Gameplay-depth milestone — making light a real mechanic (Milestone 11 "光作为机制")
**Current Goal:** The student's diagnosis that the game "还是略单调" (still a bit monotonous)

### Student Prompt
"游戏可玩性上应该怎么提升，现在还是略单调" — asked how to improve playability, not a prescribed change list.

### Agent Response Summary
Ran the plan-mode workflow: three parallel Explore agents (core-mechanics map / level-design map / world-interactables+stakes map), then three parallel Plan agents (light-mechanic systems design / new-room content design / an adversarial feasibility-&-risk review). Diagnosis the student accepted: the game has only **one puzzle axis** (every room since R3 is "switch exposure → which platforms are solid → traverse"); the toolbox never gains a new dimension; and most damning for a *darkroom* game, **light is purely decorative** — every stroke and lamp emits a real URP `Light2D` but nothing reads it. Asked the student to choose direction via a two-question prompt. They picked **光影变成真机制 (light as a real mechanic) + 新机关与威胁 (new puzzle elements)** while explicitly choosing **保留慢节奏纯解谜** (keep the slow, pure-logic, contemplative feel — no timing, no dexterity, no chase). The unifying principle: **light becomes a substance you place, route, and measure.**

The feasibility agent earned its keep: it flagged that a barrier which re-solidifies when light *leaves* inverts the one invariant the existing jam-check relies on (solidity is a pure function of `Exposure`, known *before* a switch), because light can leave asynchronously (3-stroke-budget overflow, respawn wiping strokes, the R9 blackout force-setting Normal) with no `WouldJam` guard in front of it — a crush/trap risk. It also caught the hard-wired "11" in `PhotoAlbum`/`WinScreen` that any *new room* would ripple into, and argued (correctly) to model gameplay light as a **custom emitter registry**, not by reading URP `Light2D` (decorative lamps and the player's vanity glow are indistinguishable from puzzle light, and `FindObjectsByType` per frame is unaffordable).

Built three reusable systems, each csc-verified before the next: **(1) `LightField`** — a static emitter registry (mirrors `ExposureManager`'s Register/Unregister shape) summing `intensity * linear-falloff` over registered emitters; strokes register on `Fix()` and deregister via a single `OnDestroy` (covers all three teardown paths — budget despawn, respawn `ClearAll`, too-short discard) using a per-segment nearest-distance so a long stroke lights along its whole line; the player's own glow registers with a deliberately small reach (1.5) so the player alone never trips a meter. **(2) `LightSensor`** — a `LocalLux` mode flag on `PhotoSensor` (not a fork): because the global exposure state is *not* a `LightField` emitter, a LocalLux meter inherently can't be tripped by going OVER — only delivered stroke-light trips it; latching (reuses the permanent `SensorDoor.Open()` contract), polls in `FixedUpdate`, wears a cool cyan "iris" so it reads as a different device. **(3) `UmbralBarrier`** — a sibling component (NOT a new `ExposureObjectType`, which is global-state-only): solid in shadow, recoils when lit, **re-sealing** so "shade returns when the light leaves" stays a real lesson. It guards itself rather than relying on the jam-check: re-seal is deferred while the player's expanded box overlaps it (mirroring how stroke-despawn defers while stood on), with hysteresis to stop collider chatter from a fading stroke. I deliberately dropped the planned `OnRespawn` subscription — on respawn strokes are wiped, so lux falls to ~0 and the barrier re-seals through the same guarded `FixedUpdate` path, which is *strictly safer* than an unconditional respawn-seal. Sampling was moved to the barrier's **foot** (where a ground-drawn stroke lands), so a shade can be tall enough to forbid a jump-over yet still be cleared from the floor. **Mirror/beam routing was cut** (no raycast infra; rotation controls drift toward dexterity; a drawn stroke already *is* a placeable light the player routes).

Honest note on the hardest call: where to *show* the mechanics. The Editor is open, so I could only run the Tier-1 `csc` check, not the batchmode validator, and I cannot reliably playtest the light-delivery tuning. Every existing room turned out to be tightly authored — cramming optional content in blind kept hitting conflicts (R6/R7 have checkpoints and hints sitting in the "free" space; R10's exit platform has the patrolling guard). I spent a long internal back-and-forth before settling on the two genuinely clean, conflict-free, critical-path spots: **R6's PostFloor** (flat, enemy-free, and thematically the right neighbour — it already teaches the body-sensor) gets a required **light-meter exit gate** (draw a stroke to open Door_R6L; a ceiling stops a jump-over), and **R10's PostFloor** in the finale gets a required **umbra** ("light its foot to pass — light you make yourself, not light you switch on"). Both are made **soft-lock-proof by construction**: `LightField` sums emitters and the player has a 3-stroke budget, so even with my math-only (un-playtested) thresholds (meter 0.5, umbra 0.3), stacking 2–3 strokes always clears the gate. The full **Phase B** (dedicated teaching rooms, which would ripple into `PhotoAlbum[11]`/`WinScreen`/`RoomStarts`/the finale's hard-coded `CaptureRoom(10)` and lamp-flare `x<160`) was deliberately **deferred** to a session where the tuning can be playtested.

### Development Action
3 new systems (`LightField`, `LightSensor` via a PhotoSensor mode, `UmbralBarrier`) + builder support for two new authorable element types, plus two critical-path content demos (R6 light-meter gate, R10 finale umbra). Plan-mode design pass = 6 subagents (3 Explore + 3 Plan) with an adversarial feasibility review.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LightField.cs` (new — emitter registry, SampleAt/IsLit), `UmbralBarrier.cs` (new — light-reactive barrier, foot-probe, deferred-seal guard, hysteresis), `PhotoSensor.cs` (LocalLux mode + luxThreshold + FixedUpdate poll), `TrailStroke.cs` (register on Fix / unregister on OnDestroy, per-segment `DistanceToPoint`), `PlayerController.cs` (register the player glow, small reach), `Bootstrap.cs` (LightField manager), `LevelData.cs` (`SensorDef` mode/lux overload, new `UmbralDef` struct + `RoomDef.umbrals`, R6 light-meter gate + R10 finale umbra + hints), `LevelBuilder.cs` (`Sensor` mode/lux wiring + cyan light-meter visual, new `Umbral` helper, umbrals build pass). Two new scripts' `.meta` files hand-authored in the repo's minimal no-trailing-newline format.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean at every step (`-warnaserror`, unchanged globs — no new assembly refs needed: `Light2D` and `System.Func`/`List` were already covered). Batchmode validator NOT run (Editor holds the lock); `DarkroomValidator` may need extending if the two new R6 sensor/door and the R10 umbra are counted — to be checked when the Editor is closed. No commit made (left for the student to review and commit alongside this log, per the course's commit-with-the-work rule).

### Student Follow-up
(Pending playtest — the gates that need human eyes: ① R6: in OVER, draw a stroke beside the cyan light-meter on the PostFloor — Door_R6L should open, and simply standing/going OVER without drawing should NOT open it; confirm you can't jump over the door. ② R10 finale: the new shade on the PostFloor should recoil when you lay a bright stroke at its foot, and re-seal after you pass / after a death; confirm you can't get crushed by standing in it while the stroke fades, and that 2–3 stacked strokes always clear it. ③ tune the two thresholds (meter 0.5, umbra 0.3) to taste — they were set by falloff math, not by feel. ④ if it lands well, greenlight Phase B: dedicated light-meter / umbra teaching rooms before the finale, with the `PhotoAlbum`/`WinScreen` "11"→"12+" ripple handled.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 17 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~14:10
**Development Stage:** Dev tooling (to support playtesting Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** Let the student reach R10 without replaying every room

### Student Prompt
"能给我做一个暂时的直接跳到某一关的控件让我尝试 R10 吗，不然每次都得手动通关" — a temporary jump-to-room control.

### Agent Response Summary
Added a debug room-warp behind a single `GameManager.DevWarpEnabled` const (set false for a final build). Keyboard-only to match the new-Input-System setup, Mac-friendly (no function keys): **`]` next room, `[` previous room**. Each warp grants all three abilities, fires `OnRespawn` to clear live strokes, teleports to the target room's first checkpoint (derived from `LevelData`, no hard-coded coordinates), resets exposure to Normal, refreshes the ability HUD (lock glyphs + controls + trails group), and shows a `DEV WARP → FRAME N : TITLE` banner. Clamped to `min(Rooms.Length-1, Bootstrap.BuildThroughRoomCount)` so it can't drop the player into unbuilt void in a demo build, and guarded against firing during respawn/cinematic/win.

### Development Action
One dev-only feature: room warp via `[`/`]`.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`DarkroomInput.cs` (WarpPrev/WarpNext on left/right bracket), `GameManager.cs` (`DevWarpEnabled` const, `WarpToRoom`/`RoomWarpPos`, key handling in Update), `HUDController.cs` (public `RefreshAbilityHud`).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. No new assets/meta. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Press `]` to step toward R10 — ten presses from the start, or step to any room. Remember to set `DevWarpEnabled = false` before submitting/grading. Tell me if you'd rather it drop you at a room's *last* checkpoint (closer to that room's end) instead of its start.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 18 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~14:40
**Development Stage:** Mechanic redesign — shadow lift (Milestone 11, second pass)
**Current Goal:** The student's critique that the Milestone-11 elements were too shallow

### Student Prompt
"测光表门的意义在哪里，只是画一个轨迹的话感觉不够巧妙。R10 那个门如果直接跳过去落下去也是一样的啊，可以改成比如跳过去会死，但是站在阴影墙上会像电梯一样载着用户缓慢下降" — the light-meter is just "draw a trajectory", the umbra-wall is bypassable; proposed a shadow *elevator* over a deadly drop.

### Agent Response Summary
Conceded both critiques (the light-meter had no spatial decision; a wall you light is no better than a wall). Refined the student's elevator idea by tying the control to exposure rather than making it a plain moving platform, and surfaced two real forks via a question. The student chose **exposure-controlled lift** (UNDER sinks / NORMAL holds / OVER dissolves and drops you) and **rework R9 "THE DROP"** to host it. Built a new **`ShadowLift`** component: a kinematic shadow slab, solid except in OVER (same solidity rule as BrightBarrier — too much light burns it away), that sinks in UNDER between topY/bottomY and holds in NORMAL, carries the rider explicitly (`Player.Body.position += dy` while `IsStandingOn`, so the ride doesn't depend on gravity-vs-platform timing), and resets to the top on `OnRespawn`. It is exposure-driven, NOT LightField-driven.

Reworked R9: removed the DarkPath floor-hatch free-fall, dropped a `LiftDef` shadow lift in its place (topY 9 → bottomY −1, down the existing shaft to the corridor), and rewrote the hint/objectives ("Not a dead end — this floor is shadow, and shadow sinks. Hold 1 (UNDER) to ride it down; full light burns it from under you."). The delicate part: the ScriptedBlackout arms on the *free-fall* (`velocity.y < -2`, `ScriptedBlackout.cs:118`), which a slow lift never trips — so I retargeted that one trigger to be **position-based** (`p.y < 6` inside the shaft) and left the entire corridor blackout (lamp death, exposure lock, watching shades, relight, the intricate abort/re-arm) untouched. Reverted the two shallow elements the student rejected: the R6 light-meter exit gate and the R10 PostFloor umbra, restoring both rooms to their originals.

Honest disclosure carried to the student: I kept this R9 descent **non-lethal for now** (the corridor floor stays full under the lift, so an OVER-dissolve just drops you onto the corridor). The student explicitly wanted "跳过去会死" stakes, which require offsetting the landing so a mis-flash falls into a void — that needs a step-off-tuning pass I can't do blind without risking a soft-lock at the bottom of a critical pre-finale room. Flagged it as the immediate next step once the lift's *feel* (the carried ride, possible jitter) is confirmed by playtest. Also disclosed that this pivot leaves the earlier LightField / LightSensor / UmbralBarrier systems dormant (the lift uses global exposure, not delivered light); kept their code as an optional toolkit rather than churning it out.

### Development Action
New `ShadowLift` mechanic + R9 descent rework + targeted ScriptedBlackout trigger change + revert of the two rejected M11 elements.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`ShadowLift.cs` (new — exposure-driven vertical lift, explicit rider carry, respawn reset), `LevelData.cs` (`LiftDef` struct + `RoomDef.lifts`; R9 hatch→lift, hint/objectives; reverted R6 meter gate + R10 umbra), `LevelBuilder.cs` (`Lift` builder + build pass), `ScriptedBlackout.cs` (fall-trigger velocity→position). `.meta` hand-authored for the new script.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean (no new assembly refs). Not committed. Batchmode validator still un-runnable (Editor open).

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest via the warp: press `]` to R9, then ride. Watch for: ① does the carried descent feel smooth or does the player jitter / slip off the slab? — tune `sinkSpeed` / the carry if so; ② does the corridor blackout still arm and run correctly now that the descent is slow (lamps die, slider locks, shades watch, relight at the stairs) — and does dying mid-descent re-arm cleanly? ③ does OVER mid-ride dissolve the slab and drop you as intended? Then decide: add the deadly-void version of the landing for real "flash = death" stakes, and whether to prune the dormant light-delivery systems.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 19 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~15:05
**Development Stage:** Shadow-lift redesign — UNDER-only, deadly void (Milestone 11, third pass)
**Current Goal:** The student's refined lift concept + keeping R10 + a question about the "delivered-light" system

### Student Prompt
"R10 可以再保留下我试试，那套'送光'系统(LightField / 测光表 / 阴影墙)为什么就闲置了？以及电梯托人再优化一下，改成正常模式看不到任何东西，摔下去是虚空会死，然后如果是 underexposed 会下落一段，被电梯接住，然后缓慢下降，这个概念如何"

### Agent Response Summary
Three things. **(1)** Restored the R10 umbra (the student wants to try it). Used the moment to answer the "why is the delivered-light system idle" question honestly: the 送光 system = `LightField` + its two consumers, the `LightSensor` (light-meter) and `UmbralBarrier` (umbra); the **umbra actually consumes `LightField`** (it retracts on delivered stroke-light), so restoring R10's umbra makes `LightField` + `UmbralBarrier` active again — only the shallow light-meter is set aside. The shadow lift is a *separate* mechanic driven by the global exposure state, not delivered light, which is why it doesn't touch 送光. **(2)** Reworked `ShadowLift` to the student's better concept: it is a DARK thing now — solid + visible **only in UNDER** (alpha→0, collider off in NORMAL/OVER, like a DarkPath), so in the light the shaft is just an empty deadly drop. It **waits at the top and only sinks while ridden** (`IsStandingOn`), so the player drops off the lip, free-falls a beat, is *caught*, then carried down — matching "下落一段，被电梯接住，然后缓慢下降". **(3)** Opened a real void in R9: pulled the corridor floor's left edge to 129.2 so the shaft (126.8-129.2) drops past it into the y<-10 kill plane — stepping into the shaft in the light, or letting the light back in mid-descent, now actually kills (the stakes the student asked for). The lift lands flush with the corridor (bottomY -1.8, slab top -1.5 = corridor top) so the step-off is a seamless walk-right, not a tuned hop; moved CP_R9b onto solid corridor (131, -0.7) so respawn never lands in the void.

The load-bearing catch I had to solve: the blackout force-sets NORMAL on touchdown, which with an UNDER-only lift would vanish it under the player and drop them into the void. Fixed by gating the touchdown on a new `CorridorLandX` (129.6) so the blackout only starts once she is on the **solid** corridor, past the lift — never while still riding it. Left the rest of the set piece (the position-based arm from pass two, the corridor blackout, abort/re-arm) intact.

### Development Action
`ShadowLift` redesign (UNDER-only, ride-to-sink, invisible otherwise) + R9 deadly-void geometry + blackout touchdown gate + R10 umbra restore.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`ShadowLift.cs` (solid/visible only in UNDER; sinks only while ridden; invisible in NORMAL/OVER), `LevelBuilder.cs` (lift: brighter slab, halo removed so nothing lingers in NORMAL), `LevelData.cs` (R9 lift topY 7 / bottomY −1.8 / 0.6 tall; corridor floor left edge → 129.2 void; CP_R9b → 131; hint rewrite; R10 umbra restored), `ScriptedBlackout.cs` (`CorridorLandX` gate on touchdown).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed. Validator still un-runnable (Editor open).

### Student Follow-up
(Warp `]` to R9 and try it. Watch: ① in NORMAL the shaft reads as empty and stepping in kills; ② press 1 and the shadow appears below, you drop onto it and it carries you down smoothly — or does the carry jitter / can you slip off? ③ flashing/going NORMAL mid-descent vanishes it and you fall to your death; ④ at the bottom you walk right onto the corridor seamlessly and the blackout starts only THEN — not while still on the lift (the CorridorLandX guard). If the catch/landing feel needs it, tune `sinkSpeed`, the lift topY (catch height), or bottomY (landing flush). Decide later whether to prune the now-only-idle light-meter or repurpose it as the spatial "send light somewhere unreachable" puzzle.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 20 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~15:45
**Development Stage:** Expanding the exposure vocabulary (Milestone 11, fourth pass)
**Current Goal:** "明/暗能干嘛"不止 UNDER 平台 + OVER 开门 — the student wanted the verb-set widened, plus a specific "Burn Paper" idea

### Student Prompt
"可以 1,2,3都做做，顺手把design优化一下，变暗的轨迹现在比较粗糙，变亮烧掉也是不够好，可以尝试这个想法：Over 可以'烧穿'，但会留下永久伤痕 …… Burn Paper / 烧纸机关 …… 1.5 秒后烧出洞 …… 但持续 Over 会唤醒敌人 …… 玩家要先在 Under 画好逃跑路径，再切 Over 烧门，门开后立刻切 Normal 或 Under 逃走。"

### Agent Response Summary
Built **five new exposure-driven mechanics** as reusable components, plus a **dev-only "mechanic lab"** to test them without any 11-frame ripple. (1) **`BurnPaper`** — the student's idea: a white sheet that, held in OVER within range ~1.5 s, heats and then burns a PERMANENT hole (collider off for good, charred scar stays); leaving OVER cools it. No energy bar — the tension is exactly that OVER also wakes the light-sensitive guard, so burning is a committed act (draw an escape in UNDER first, burn in OVER, flee). (2) **`DarkTrail`** — the "粗糙" complaint fixed: a refined tapered glowing *streak* (curved, smooth corners, its own light), solid + visible only in UNDER — built on the player-stroke visual + a DarkStroke ExposureObject with per-segment bounds, not a block. (3) **LightBridge** (builder only) — a glowing slab solid only in OVER (ExposureObject type BrightStroke), the bright twin of a dark platform: "变亮"不止开门. (4) **`FixPlatform` / 定影** — a faint ghost that PRINTS permanently solid the first time you flash OVER near it (guarded so it never develops onto the player); planning, not a held state. (5) **`RiseLift` / 光浮力** — the faithful mirror of ShadowLift: a light slab real only in OVER that rises (the vertical complement to R9's sinking shadow).

The **dev lab** (`LevelBuilder.BuildDevSandbox`, built only when `DevWarpEnabled`) sits at x≈392+ off the real level, with five labeled stations (trail arc / light-bridge gap / burn-wall+guard / latent staircase / rise-lift shaft) over a forgiving catch-floor. New warp key **P** jumps there (`GameManager.WarpToLab`); `[`/`]` still step the real rooms. So the whole batch is testable immediately and is 100% isolated from the graded game (nothing built, no keys live, when `DevWarpEnabled=false`).

### Development Action
5 new mechanic components + 5 builder methods + a dev sandbox + a lab warp key.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `BurnPaper.cs`, `DarkTrail.cs`, `FixPlatform.cs`, `RiseLift.cs` (+ hand-authored `.meta`s). `LevelBuilder.cs` (Trail / LightBridge / BurnWall / Latent / LightLift builders + `BuildDevSandbox`). `DarkroomInput.cs` (`LabWarpPressed` = P). `GameManager.cs` (`WarpToLab`). LightBridge reuses the existing BrightStroke solidity matrix; DarkTrail reuses the stroke visual + ExposureObject per-segment jam test.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean (no new assembly refs). Four new `.meta`s at the repo's 59-byte no-trailing-newline format. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Press **P** for the lab, then walk left→right through the five stations. Watch especially: ① BurnPaper — does ~1.5 s in OVER burn it and does the hole STAY after you leave OVER / die-respawn? does the guard create the intended pressure? ② DarkTrail — does it read as a smooth glowing streak (not a block) and is it solid only in UNDER? ③ the two carry-rides — RiseLift up and (in R9) ShadowLift down — smooth or jittery? ④ FixPlatform — flashing OVER near the ghosts prints them and they persist. Then we promote the winners from the lab into real rooms — that's the step that finally touches the 11→12+ ripple. Also still pending: tune R9 lift feel; prune-or-repurpose the idle light-meter.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 21 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~16:30
**Development Stage:** Lab playtest fixes (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** Three issues the student hit testing the lab, plus the "where is it" camera bug

### Student Prompt
First: "沙盒里直接人物都不见了，只有场景". Then, after the camera fix: "测试下来基本没有问题，但现在人物似乎只能走平路，那个暗的斜轨迹必须要跳跃才能上去，然后光的轨迹比正常砖块略低一点也上不去，得跳一下，修复这个 bug。最后烧墙不是瞬间的，应该有个动画过程".

### Agent Response Summary
**Camera bug:** `CameraFollow` clamps the camera to `MaxX = 170` (the real level's edge), so warping to the lab at x≈394 teleported the player fine but stranded the camera at x170 — "scene but no character." Fix: made the bounds settable; `WarpToLab` widens them and snaps onto the player, `WarpToRoom` restores the real-level bounds and snaps (also kills the long pan).

**Three playtest fixes:**
1. **No slope walking** — movement set `v.x` directly + gravity, so any incline is a wall. Added slope support to `PlayerController`: `GroundCheck` raycasts for the surface normal; `FixedUpdate` walks ALONG the surface tangent when grounded (flat ground → horizontal, y stays 0, identical feel; slopes → carried up/down; zero input → zero velocity so the frictionless body never slides). HONEST RISK noted to the student: this also makes player-drawn *strokes* walkable as ramps, which could subtly ease the real stroke rooms (R3/R4/R5/R10) — needs a real-rooms playtest.
2. **Light bridge lip** — its top sat 0.05 below the adjacent ledges and a flat-bottomed box can't step a lip; remade it flush. Also discovered the lab's dark-trail rose from a floor that was still under it (you'd walk *under* it), so I rebuilt the lab so trail/bridge cross real GAPS (over the void; a fall respawns at the lab start, which P also resets), and the trail starts flush with the platform — so with slope support you simply walk across.
3. **Instant burn** — rewrote `BurnPaper`'s feedback: a child ember glow swells and flickers over the ~1.5 s, the sheet browns, and a `StrokeSparkle.Burst` marks the burn-through, so the burn now reads as a process.

### Development Action
Camera-bounds fix + slope-walking in the player + light-bridge flush + lab gap-redesign + burn-through animation.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`CameraFollow.cs` (settable bounds + `SetBounds`), `GameManager.cs` (`SnapCamera`, bounds in both warps), `PlayerController.cs` (ground-normal raycast + tangent movement), `BurnPaper.cs` (ember/flicker/spark animation), `LevelBuilder.cs` (`BuildDevSandbox` rebuilt with gaps; light bridge flush).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Re-test the lab via P: the dark streak and light bridge should now be WALKED across (no hop), and the burn should visibly heat → spark → hole. Then the important regression check: play a few REAL stroke rooms (R3 "First Stroke", R4 "Contact Sheet", R10) to confirm slope-walking didn't make drawn-stroke climbs feel off or break a jump. Still pending from before: R9 lift feel, light-meter fate, and promoting lab winners into real rooms.)

## Interaction 22 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~17:00
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** "测下来没问题。可以放入正式关卡" — the lab mechanics passed; put them in the game

### Student Prompt
"测下来没问题。可以放入正式关卡" — then chose, from a question I raised, to **keep the 11-frame narrative and weave the new mechanics into existing rooms** (rather than add rooms, which would change "one roll, eleven frames" and trigger the album/win-screen/numbering ripple).

### Agent Response Summary
Raised the narrative consequence first: new rooms would dilute "eleven frames" and touch the hard-wired 11 (PhotoAlbum, WinScreen, captions, the finale's `CaptureRoom(10)` / lamp-flare). The student chose the narrative-safe, zero-ripple path — integrate into the existing 11. Doing it ONE room at a time so each is playtested. First and clearest: **Burn Paper → R2 "THE WHITE WALL."** Replaced R2's instant-vanishing `BrightBarrier` with a `BurnPaper` wall (added `BurnDef` + `RoomDef.burns` + a build pass so it's data-authored, not just a lab call). Now you collect the flash, then must HOLD over the white wall ~1.5 s while it heats and burns a permanent hole — and R2's existing stationary enemy wakes in OVER while you do it, which is exactly the committed-act tension the mechanic wants, with no new geometry. Rewrote the hint to match ("it won't just vanish — hold OVEREXPOSED and it BURNS").

### Development Action
Set the integration approach (keep 11 frames) + first placement: Burn Paper into R2.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (`BurnDef` struct + `RoomDef.burns`; R2 swap barrier→burn wall + hint). `LevelBuilder.cs` (burns build pass).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest R2 (warp `]` ×2): the white wall should heat → spark → leave a hole only after ~1.5 s of OVER, the eyes wake while you burn, and the hole is permanent. Then I'll continue one room at a time — proposed next: Dark Trail, Light Bridge, Rise Lift, Fix — confirming the room for each before I touch it.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 23 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~17:20
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** "R1 不改，4，8 改一改" — protect the first lesson; put Rise Lift in R4 and Light Bridge in R8

### Student Prompt
"好嘞，R1 不改，4，8 改一改" — keep R1 (tutorial) as-is; change R4 and R8.

### Agent Response Summary
Added `BridgeDef` + `RiseDef` structs + `RoomDef.bridges`/`riseLifts` + build passes (data-authored, like the burns). **R4 "CONTACT SHEET":** added a `RiseLift` rising from the floor's right edge over a deadly drop up to the existing high ledge — OVER summons it, ride it up; leaving OVER mid-air drops you into the void. Reframed the objective/hint from "two strokes" to "ride the light to the top" (the mirror of R9's sinking shadow; strokes still possible but the lift is the featured, easier path). **R8 "NEGATIVE TRANSFER":** this room's whole point is mode-switch consequence, so I made it literal — removed the old BrightBarrier (+ ceiling) and put a `LightBridge` (solid only in OVER) across a new gap between the anchors, after the existing DarkStep (solid only in UNDER). Now: cross the dark step in UNDER → land on AnchorA (real ground) → switch to OVER, the light bridge appears → cross to the mid ledge; switch on the wrong platform and it vanishes from under you. Burning-through is no longer here (it moved to R2), which de-duplicates the verbs. Hint rewritten to teach the dark-vs-light platform pairing.

### Development Action
Two real-room integrations: Rise Lift → R4, Light Bridge → R8 (+ the data structs/passes).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (`BridgeDef`/`RiseDef` + `RoomDef.bridges`/`riseLifts`; R4 rise lift + reframed objective/hint; R8 barrier→light-bridge over a gap + hint). `LevelBuilder.cs` (bridges + riseLifts build passes).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest R4 (warp `]` ×4) and R8 (×8). R4: in OVER a light slab should rise from the right edge — ride it to the ledge; confirm leaving OVER mid-ride drops you and that it's completable. R8: dark step in UNDER → stand on the anchor → OVER makes the light bridge → cross; confirm switching mid-bridge drops you and that the anchors give you safe footing to switch on. Remaining lab mechanics still to place: Dark Trail (NOT R1 — needs a new home) and Fix/定影. Also still pending: R9 lift feel, light-meter fate.)

## Interaction 24 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~17:45
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** Burn-walls everywhere; make R8 less trivial; rethink Dark Trail + Fix design

### Student Prompt
"把所有烧白墙都装上，然后R8 的光桥太简单了，做的更有设计一点，Dark Trail 和Fix / 定影的设计再思考一下"

### Agent Response Summary
**All white walls → BurnPaper.** Converted the remaining `BrightBarrier`s — R5's entry gate and R10's two barriers — to `BurnPaper` (hold OVER ~1.5 s to burn a permanent hole). With R2 already converted, `BrightBarrier` is now retired from the levels entirely, so I dropped its unused `BB` alias (the enum/ExposureObject code stays). R5's gate burn wakes the patrol enemy as you do it; R10's FINAL barrier burns right under the guard's nose — both add the committed-act tension for free. **R8 "too simple" → real puzzle.** Replaced the single flat light bridge with an ALTERNATING climb over a deadly drop: dark step (UNDER) → real anchor → light bridge (OVER) → real anchor → dark step (UNDER) → ledge. Each segment exists in only one exposure, so you must switch ONLY while standing on an anchor — switch on a step or the bridge and it vanishes beneath you. Two forced switches, rising, with fall-to-void stakes; this turns R8's stated lesson ("land on real ground before you switch") into an actual dance instead of a one-line bridge. **Dark Trail + Fix design** ("再思考一下"): launched a background design workflow — two designer agents (one per mechanic) studying the real rooms in parallel to propose clever, non-trivial placements (NOT R1), then a critic to pick the best for each and flag clashes with the newly-added mechanics. Results pending.

### Development Action
All white walls → BurnPaper (R5, R10 ×2) + retire BrightBarrier alias; R8 single bridge → alternating dark/light anchor-switch puzzle; launched the Dark-Trail/Fix design workflow.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (R5 gate→burn + hint; R10 two barriers→burns; R8 rebuilt as the alternating climb + hint; removed the `BB` alias). No builder change (burns/bridges passes already existed).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed. Dark-Trail/Fix design proposals still computing in the background.

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest the burns: R5 (`]`×5) gate burns while the patrol wakes; R10 (`]`×10) two barriers burn, the final one with the guard right there. R8 (`]`×8): the alternating UNDER-step / OVER-bridge climb — confirm switching on a step/bridge drops you and the anchors give safe footing, and that it's completable. Dark Trail + Fix placement options coming once the design pass finishes.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 25 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~18:10
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** Fix the R8 skip-bug; place the Dark Trail (design pass returned)

### Student Prompt
"好的，以及现在 R8 中间这个很短，不切换模式都能直接跳过去" — approved the plan; reported that R8's middle gaps are short enough to jump across without switching exposure.

### Agent Response Summary
**R8 skip-bug fixed.** My alternating R8 had gaps of only ~0.25–0.8u between platforms; with a flat jump reaching ~5.5u those were trivially skippable, so the dark-step/bridge never mattered (the student was right). Rebuilt R8 as **two WIDE bridges over a deadly drop, each spanning a ~6u gap that genuinely can't be jumped** (computed against JumpForce 12.5 / gravity 3.2 → ~2.49u apex, ~4.7u horizontal on a rising jump): a light bridge (OVER-only) → one real anchor → a dark bridge (UNDER-only) → mid ledge. You MUST switch exposure (you can't skip either bridge), and the only safe place to switch is the anchor between them. Flipped the order so the LAST segment is the dark bridge (UNDER) — you arrive on the mid ledge in UNDER, so the watcher stays stone as you land (no death on arrival). One switch, but un-skippable and consequential.

**Dark Trail → R6 "SENSOR TEST"** (the design pass's pick). The agent/critic recommended *three forking trails* and a "read which arc lands on real ground" puzzle. I adopted the idea but **rejected the forking geometry**: with this engine the player's ground-check just follows whichever collider is under their feet, so crossing/overlapping trails would yank you onto the wrong one — finicky and unfair. Authored instead as **two clearly-separated, non-crossing dark streaks** (visible only in UNDER): a bold high arc that crests ~6.3 and **dies in mid-air**, and a gentle one that comes to rest on `R6_SensorAnchor`. Same "read where each streak ends" intent, robust. Replaced R6's two blocky dark climbing-shelves; sensor/door/ceiling untouched; crests kept ≤6.3 and endpoints left of the door so no arc gives a launch pad past it.

Wired the data path for trails (`TrailDef` + `RoomDef.trails` + build pass), so DarkTrail is now data-authorable like the other new elements.

### Development Action
R8 single-switch un-skippable wide-bridge rebuild; Dark Trail (2 non-crossing streaks) into R6; `TrailDef` wiring.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (R8 rebuilt as wide light/dark bridges + hint; R6 shelves → two dark trails + read hint; `TrailDef` struct + `RoomDef.trails`). `LevelBuilder.cs` (trails build pass).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest R8 (`]`×8): confirm you now CAN'T jump the gaps without switching, that OVER crosses the bright bridge / UNDER the dark one, switching mid-bridge drops you, and you land on the dark side with the watcher asleep. R6 (`]`×6): in UNDER two streaks appear — confirm the gentle one walks cleanly up to the sensor anchor and the bold one dead-ends; tell me if walking the curve feels off (slope steepness). If the 2-trail read feels too easy we can try the 3-fork once we've confirmed trail-walk physics. Fix/定影 still needs a home — R8 now has only one anchor, so the earlier "ghost the 2nd anchor" idea no longer applies; I'll propose a fresh spot.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 26 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~18:30
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** The Dark Trail felt wrong in R6

### Student Prompt
"R6 的两条轨迹太奇怪了" → on a follow-up question, clarified the issue is **placement** ("轨迹放 R6 本身不搭" — the trail doesn't suit R6; prefer the original shelves and move Dark Trail somewhere it crosses a gap naturally).

### Agent Response Summary
Restored R6 to its original clean sensor puzzle (the two `R6_DarkShelfA/B` dark climbing-blocks and the "UNDER reveals the route up" hint) — the forking-trail read was an over-design of a room that was already fine. Moved the **Dark Trail to R10's opening**, replacing the two dark step-blocks (`R10_DarkStepA/B`) the player used to reveal-in-UNDER-and-jump up to the first anchor. Now a single dark streak (solid/visible only in UNDER) bridges the start platform up to `R10_AnchorA` over the void — reveal it, then *walk* the continuous curve instead of hopping blocks. It's the trail's natural "a path you reveal in the dark and traverse," it genuinely bridges a gap, and it's a clean swap (no added complexity in an already-busy finale; it sits before all the burns/umbra/sensor).

### Development Action
Revert R6 to dark shelves; relocate Dark Trail → R10 opening (swap for the dark step-blocks).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`LevelData.cs` (R6 trails removed + shelves/hint restored; R10 `DarkStepA/B` → one `R10_DarkTrail` bridging start→anchor).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Playtest R10 (`]`×10) at the very start: in UNDER a glowing streak should bridge the start platform up to the first anchor — walk it cleanly to AnchorA, then the finale proceeds (burn, sensor, umbra, burn). Confirm the curve walks without sliding. Still pending: a home for Fix/定影.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 27 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~18:40
**Development Stage:** Promoting lab mechanics into the real rooms (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** The R10 dark trail should be invisible in NORMAL

### Student Prompt
"顺的，但是让这条带子在normal状态下不可见，不然太明显了" — the walk feels good, but make the streak invisible in NORMAL (it's too obvious otherwise).

### Agent Response Summary
The `DarkStroke` alpha matrix leaves a faint 0.18 alpha in NORMAL (so player-drawn strokes ghost faintly) — which made the level's trail visible before you reveal it. Overrode visibility in `DarkTrail.OnAlphaApplied` only: `vis = InverseLerp(0.18, 1, a)`, so the streak (line + glow + light) is fully ZERO in NORMAL and OVER and only fades in for UNDER. Solidity is unchanged (already UNDER-only), and player-drawn DarkStrokes are untouched (the change lives in the DarkTrail component, not the shared matrix). Now it's a true hidden path the dark reveals.

### Development Action
DarkTrail: invisible in NORMAL/OVER, visible only in UNDER.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`DarkTrail.cs` (OnAlphaApplied visibility override).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(R10 start: in NORMAL the path should be invisible; press 1 (UNDER) to reveal the streak, then walk it. Pending: Fix/定影 home.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 28 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-15 ~22:00
**Development Stage:** Cinematic aesthetic uplift (Milestone 11)
**Current Goal:** Make the whole game read more filmic (INSIDE-like), fix the rough inter-frame flow, and lift the HUD/fonts/UI

### Student Prompt
"提升一下整体的美学质感，现在轨迹，人物，墙壁，地板，灯光都太像素化了，我想做成更电影的质感，比如 inside 那样。然后每个关卡之间的存档，进入下一关，提示等也安排的比较潦草。HUD，字体，UI 也可以有很大提升" — picked all four recommended scope options (full cinematic pass reusing the architecture; transition polish only, no persistent save; keep the viewfinder UI identity but refine; external assets allowed as needed).

### Agent Response Summary
Audited the visual stack (read-first-hand + a fan-out audit workflow) and found the architecture is already strong — the "pixelated/cheap" look came from a few pipeline decisions, chiefly that **URP post-processing was authored but dormant** (every effect at intensity 0, and nothing enabled post on the runtime camera). Six mechanically-neutral workstreams:
- **WS1 post foundation:** new `PostFXDirector` builds a global Volume in code (ACES + Bloom + Vignette + ColorAdjustments + FilmGrain) lerped per exposure (mirrors `LightDirector`); `Bootstrap` enables camera post-processing + SMAA + HDR; URP asset → MSAA 4 + HDR grading; Renderer2D `LightRenderTextureScale` 0.5→1; HUD's duplicate grain/vignette overlays retired.
- **WS2 edges:** `SilhouetteArt` now supersamples (4×) + alpha-weighted box-downsamples → anti-aliased character/enemy silhouettes; all `PixelArt` generated textures `Point`→`Bilinear`; door tile re-rendered at 4× density; `WhiteSprite` bilinear.
- **WS3/WS4 light & glow:** warmer/filmic key in `LightDirector`; HDR-bright lamp bulbs + exit doorway so bloom blooms them; warmer/stronger player aura.
- **WS5 type:** `FontLoader.Display` (bundle `Resources/Fonts/Display.ttf`, else OS Optima/Didot…, else Mono); `HUDController.NewText` gained `display`/`shadow` options; narrative beats (title, banners, checkpoint/death notes, hints, "DEVELOPED") use the display face while the viewfinder readouts stay Mono.
- **WS6 flow:** boot fade-up under a brief letterbox; "FRAME N" beat on entering each frame; softer checkpoint develop-flash; fading hint bubbles; widescreen letterbox + warm post-grade for the finale.
TMP was the planned font path but its runtime SDF shaders live only in the (un-imported) "TMP Essential Resources" package and importing them is an editor-only step that would break the UI if the editor were mid-session — so the robust legacy-`Text` + display-face route was used (the plan's documented fallback). TMP can be adopted later by importing Essentials.

### Development Action
Cinematic post-processing + anti-aliasing + display-font UI + letterbox/frame-card flow, reusing the existing 2D-light/backdrop/HUD systems; gameplay untouched.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New `Core/PostFXDirector.cs`. Edited `Core/Bootstrap.cs`, `Core/LightDirector.cs`, `Core/FontLoader.cs`, `Core/GameManager.cs`, `Core/PixelArt.cs`, `Core/SilhouetteArt.cs`, `Core/VisualFactory.cs`, `Level/LevelBuilder.cs`, `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs`, `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs`, `UI/HUDController.cs`, `UI/WinScreen.cs`; `Settings/UniversalRP.asset` (MSAA 4, HDR grading), `Settings/Renderer2D.asset` (light scale 1); `README.md` notes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean across all five script dirs. Not committed. Batchmode `Darkroom.EditorTools.Validate` + an in-editor Play screenshot pass still pending (editor was open during the change).

### Student Follow-up
(Tab back to Unity to let it recompile, press Play: expect bloomed lamps/strokes/exit, graded exposure states, anti-aliased silhouettes, the display-font title/cards, the boot fade-up, "FRAME N" beats, and a letterboxed warm finale. To make the display font deterministic in builds, drop a licensed `Display.ttf` into `Resources/Fonts/`.)

## Interaction 29 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~00:00
**Development Stage:** Live brightness/backdrop tuning + gameplay-element redesign (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** Normal/Under too dark; background went flat; then "redesign almost all elements — they're just blocks and rectangles"

### Student Prompt
Three follow-ups, tuned live by driving Unity (keyboard-only — clicks mis-route on the Studio Display): (1) "normal 和 underexposed 都太暗了" → drive the editor and tune against the screen; (2) "背景怎么是纯色了，想看到后方建筑物体"; (3) "underexposed 还是太暗了"; then "把暗色路径、过曝烧墙等几乎所有元素重新设计，现在都太简单了，就只是方块、矩形" — direction: metaphor-first (darkroom/photography) + some abstract + industrial where it fits; all elements; animated; keep the exposure colour-coding, change only the form.

### Agent Response Summary
**Live tuning (computer-use):** raised the global light (Normal 0.92→1.38, Under 0.22→0.74) and post-exposure (Normal +0.36, Under +0.32), eased vignette/contrast — confirmed on-screen per exposure. Found the flat background was the new ACES+contrast crushing the very dark parallax silhouettes into the clear colour; switched the backdrop decor + brick patches to the **unlit** material with lifted colours so the architecture reads in *every* exposure (and is no longer light-dependent). Hardened a transient `GameManager:57` NRE with a null-guard.
**Element redesign (Milestone 12):** new `ProcGfx` (supersampled AA `Canvas` promoted from SilhouetteArt's drawer + net-new `FillCircle/StrokeLine/FillPolygon/RimAll/Grain` + cached texture generators) and reusable `Drift`/`FrameCycle` drivers; a `PauseController` guard added to `GlowPulse`. Added additive fade/event hooks to the self-fader behaviours (`onAlpha` on UmbralBarrier/ShadowLift/RiseLift; `OnCharProgress`/`OnBurned` on BurnPaper; `OnOpen` on SensorDoor; a develop coroutine in FixPlatform) — gameplay logic untouched. Rebuilt every element's visuals in `LevelBuilder` (DarkPath film-strip, LightBridge beam, BrightBarrier framed pane, BurnPaper char/ember, UmbralBarrier roil, FixPlatform develop-in, both lifts with catch-light/underglow/rails, SensorDoor safelight lamp, Checkpoint spark, Exit motes). Colliders/sizes/solidity matrix and colour-coding preserved throughout.

### Development Action
Brightness + backdrop tuned live to the screen; all gameplay elements redesigned into layered, animated objects via a shared procedural-art toolkit + additive behaviour hooks.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `Core/ProcGfx.cs`, `World/Drift.cs`, `World/FrameCycle.cs`. Edited `Core/{LightDirector,PostFXDirector,PixelArt}.cs`; `Level/{LevelBuilder,BackdropBuilder}.cs`; `World/{ExposureObject? (no), UmbralBarrier,BurnPaper,FixPlatform,ShadowLift,RiseLift,SensorDoor,Checkpoint,GlowPulse}.cs`; `Core/GameManager.cs` (NRE guard); `README.md`.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean throughout. Live-verified in the editor: brighter Normal/Under, backdrop visible in all exposures, and the DarkPath film-strip, DarkTrail curve and BurnPaper char→burn-through. BrightBarrier/Umbral/lifts/FixPlatform/door compile and use the same proven pattern (live spot-check still recommended). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Press Play and walk the rooms / use `]` `[` warp + `P` dev-lab to see each element in each exposure. Pending: batchmode `Darkroom.EditorTools.Validate` for gameplay-neutrality once the editor is closed; optional finer-detail passes per element if any read too subtle at gameplay scale.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 30 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~00:20
**Development Stage:** Polish follow-ups (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** "自己画出的轨迹有点太普通" + "overexposed 可读性太低，很多元素都看不到"

### Student Prompt
Two refinements after the element redesign: (1) the player-drawn trajectory looks too plain — make it nicer; (2) Over mode is too washed-out — many elements are unreadable.

### Agent Response Summary
**Drawn trail:** the glow line was a hard-edged translucent bar. Added a feathered cross-section texture (`ProcGfx.SoftBeamTex`) + a shared `VisualFactory.BeamMat`, and switched both the player stroke (`TrailStroke`) and the level's pre-authored `DarkTrail` glow LineRenderers to it (LineTextureMode.Stretch, width ×5, alpha 0.55) — so a drawn stroke now reads as a soft glowing light beam (bright core + soft falloff) that blooms, instead of a flat bar. Verified by drawing a DarkStroke in Under.
**Over readability:** Over was blowing to white (high post-exposure + strong bloom → low contrast). Re-graded Over to be bright via even *lighting* but readable: global light 1.35→1.45, postExposure +0.35→+0.10, bloom 1.65→1.0, contrast 6→12, vignette 0.14→0.22. Verified in the white-wall room — elements (pane, floor, pickup, enemy, backdrop) now clearly distinguishable in Over.

### Development Action
Feathered soft-beam material for drawn/authored light strokes; Over grade rebalanced for readability.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/ProcGfx.cs` (SoftBeamTex), `Core/VisualFactory.cs` (BeamMat), `Player/TrailStroke.cs`, `World/DarkTrail.cs`, `Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverIntensity), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (Over grade).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Live-verified: the drawn stroke is a soft glowing beam; Over is readable. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Both confirmed on-screen. Pending: batchmode validator once the editor is closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 31 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~11:20
**Development Stage:** OVER readability + backdrop depth tuning (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** "overexposed 可读性太低" / "背景远处的元素看不清" (with a screenshot of a flat warm wash)

### Student Prompt
After the OVER re-grade the screen was still a flat warm-grey wash — distant background elements unreadable.

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed two stacked causes from the screenshot: (1) OVER was flooding the frame with light (global 1.45 + exposure) so everything lifted to one mid-grey, and the strong bloom hazed the whole scene; (2) the backdrop is two full parallax layers whose props were all a similar mid-grey, tiling the frame into a flat field with no dark gaps. Fixes: made **bloom threshold per-exposure** (`PostFXDirector.Grade.bloomThreshold`; OVER = 1.2 so only true HDR sources bloom, not the lit scene); cut OVER flood (global light 1.45→1.15, postExposure→0, contrast→18); and gave the backdrop **wide per-layer value ranges** (`BackdropBuilder` Far 0.085→0.205, Near 0.150→0.345, brick patch receded to 0.15) so props vary dim→bright, distant shapes separate, and dark gaps return for contrast. Verified on-screen in OVER and Normal — both now have depth/contrast and the distant box reads.

### Development Action
Per-exposure bloom threshold; OVER de-flooded; backdrop given wide value variation for contrast/depth.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (per-grade bloomThreshold + OVER grade), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverIntensity 1.15), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (layer value ranges + brick).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` compile clean. Live-verified OVER + Normal readability. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Confirm OVER/Normal read well across rooms; tune backdrop ranges further if distant props want to be more/less prominent.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 32 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~13:45
**Development Stage:** OVER re-implementation + tooling root-cause (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** "仔细思考过曝有没有别的实现办法，现在还是太泛白、缺少层次"

### Student Prompt
OVER still read as a flat warm-white wash with no tonal layers; asked for a genuinely different implementation.

### Agent Response Summary
Re-implemented OVER as **graded overexposure** instead of a light flood: lowered the global flood (`LightDirector.OverIntensity` 1.45→1.0), neutralised the uniform warm colour filter, added a **SplitToning** post override (warm highlights / faint-cool shadows) for tonal+colour separation, and tuned bloom to **halate only true highlights** (threshold ~1.0). Retired the legacy full-screen HUD exposure wash (`HUDController.OverlayOver` 0.26→0, `OverlayUnder` 0.34→0.10) now that the post grade tints without flattening.
**Root cause of the whole struggle:** several rounds of OVER edits had *no on-screen effect*. A `Debug.Log` diagnostic showed **0 console logs** → Unity was running a **stale assembly** (Auto Refresh off; app focus + ⌘P do not recompile). Forcing **⌘R (Assets→Refresh)** before ⌘P made every edit live, and a postExposure=-1.5 probe then visibly crushed OVER → confirmed the post grade was wired correctly all along. Saved this as a memory ([[darkroom-unity-recompile]]). With code actually live, OVER/Normal/Under all verified: OVER now has deep shadows + warm blooming highlights + readable backdrop (layers, not white).

### Development Action
Graded-overexposure OVER (split-tone + halation + lower flood); HUD exposure wash retired; documented the ⌘R-before-⌘P recompile gotcha.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (SplitToning override + per-grade fields, OVER grade), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverIntensity 1.0), `UI/HUDController.cs` (overlay washes reduced/removed).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean. Live-verified (after ⌘R) OVER is layered & readable, Normal/Under unaffected. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Always ⌘R before ⌘P when testing. Pending: batchmode validator once the editor is closed; fine-tune split-tone warmth / OVER brightness to taste.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 33 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~13:58
**Development Stage:** OVER brightness/identity balance (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** "over 和 normal 区分不明显了，over 还应是过曝效果，但别太影响可读性"

### Student Prompt
The graded OVER had become too dark/similar to Normal — it lost its "overexposed" identity. Make OVER clearly brighter/overexposed while keeping elements readable.

### Agent Response Summary
The earlier flat-wash culprit was the (now-retired) HUD overlay, so OVER can be genuinely bright again WITHOUT washing: pushed the look via **global light + highlight bloom + a warm amber tint** (which lift the LIT play surfaces and halate highlights = the overexposed glow) rather than a uniform post-exposure lift (which would also raise the unlit backdrop and hurt readability). `LightDirector.OverIntensity` 1.0→1.7, `OverColor` warmer amber (1.0,0.90,0.74); OVER grade bloom 0.45→0.95 @ threshold 1.0→0.8, warm filter (1.07,1.0,0.89), postExposure kept low (0.12), contrast 8. Verified A/B: Normal = neutral/cool & dim; OVER = warm/amber, brighter, glowing — clearly distinct, and the backdrop silhouettes / wall / pickup / awake enemy all still read.

### Development Action
OVER re-brightened for a distinct overexposed identity via light+bloom+warm tint (readability preserved).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverIntensity 1.7, OverColor amber), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (OVER grade bloom/threshold/filter).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean. Live-verified (⌘R then ⌘P) OVER distinct & readable vs Normal. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tune OverIntensity / warm filter to taste. Pending: batchmode validator once the editor is closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 34 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~14:20
**Development Stage:** Per-exposure background colour (Milestone 12)
**Current Goal:** Student's idea — give each mode its own BACKGROUND colour (Under deep-blue / Normal black-grey / Over warm-white) instead of a screen mask, so readability isn't hurt

### Student Prompt
"可以通过调整这三种模式背景的颜色，而不是只在画面上加一个遮罩…under 深蓝, normal 黑/灰, over 暖白色."

### Agent Response Summary
Implemented per-exposure background two ways: `LightDirector` now lerps the **camera clear colour** per state (Under deep-blue / Normal near-black / Over warm-white), and a new `World/BackdropTint.cs` (on `_Backdrop`) lerps the **parallax backdrop** toward the state tint — necessary because the backdrop occludes the camera clear, so it carries the visible background (lamps excluded). Lowered OVER global light (1.7→1.3) and de-warmed the OVER post filter toward neutral since the background now carries the warmth — OVER's overexposed read = bright warm background + moderate warm light + highlight bloom, foreground legible. Verified all three: Under = deep-blue back, Normal = near-black, Over = bright warm (warm-lit brick) — each clearly distinct with the player/lamp/pickup/enemy readable against it.

### Development Action
Per-exposure background colour via camera clear + BackdropTint; OVER warmth moved from screen filter to the background.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New `World/BackdropTint.cs` (+meta). Edited `Core/LightDirector.cs` (per-state camera bg + OverIntensity), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (OVER grade de-warmed), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (attach BackdropTint), `Assets/README.md`.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean. Live-verified (⌘R then ⌘P) all three background colours distinct + readable. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(OVER reads as warm brick, not flat warm-white — can push BackdropTint OverStrength/OverTint further toward white if wanted. Pending: batchmode validator once editor closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 35 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~14:45
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — phase 1
**Current Goal:** Student feels the backdrop/scenery is monotonous and code-generated (the red-brick wall especially ugly); wants richer *illustrated* art, sourced from the web and/or AI image models

### Student Prompt
"现在背景、场景元素有点单一了，都是代码生成的，尤其那个砖墙很丑，我想引入更多精美的插画类型，丰富画面，可以从网上下载或者采用一些 AI 模型来制作." (Chosen direction: use all sources — CC0 web where good assets exist, student-run AI image-gen for the rest with agent-written prompts, code for simple elements; scope = full illustrated environment set.)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed the flatness: the wall is a saturated **red-brick photo** (`bricks.jpg`) clashing with the monochrome cinematic palette, and the backdrop props are flat axis-aligned colour boxes. Set up an out-of-`Assets` art pipeline (`art-pipeline/`): an `ART_DIRECTION.md` (locked palette pulled from `VisualFactory`, depth-layer plan, per-element source track) and an `IMAGE_GEN_PROMPTS.md` prompt pack (shared STYLE/NEGATIVE blocks + 6 hero backdrops + 7 prop cutouts, tuned to the palette and the engine's placement) for the student to generate. **Phase-1 landed change:** authored three seamless, palette-fit dark wall textures in Python (`gen_walls.py` → `StreamingAssets/art/wall_{plaster,concrete,panel}.png`, FFT periodic noise = guaranteed tileable) and rewired `PixelArt`: new `LoadExternalFirst(...)` prioritised loader (authored `art/…` → legacy photo → procedural), `BrickTile`→`WallTile` (cool dark plaster, no red), `ConcreteTile` now prefers the cooler authored concrete; `BackdropBuilder.BrickPatch`→`WallPatch` retuned (old 0.15 tint was for the bright photo, would crush the darker art to black). Launched a background CC0-research workflow (PolyHaven/ambientCG walls, OpenGameArt/Wikimedia illustrations) to source better walls + any usable illustrated assets. The `LoadExternal`-with-fallback architecture means AI/CC0 PNGs dropped into `StreamingAssets/art/` slot in live without code changes and nothing breaks while assets are pending.

### Development Action
Replaced the clashing red-brick wall with authored cool-dark plaster (palette-fit, seamless); stood up the art pipeline, prompt pack, and a prioritised authored→photo→procedural loader; kicked off CC0 asset research.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `art-pipeline/{ART_DIRECTION.md, IMAGE_GEN_PROMPTS.md, gen_walls.py, gen_backdrops.py}`; `Assets/StreamingAssets/art/wall_{plaster,concrete,panel}.png` (authored) + `bd_{cornell,sellwood,engraving,jeffcoat}.png` (PD darkroom photos/engraving restyled to palette). Edited: `Core/PixelArt.cs` (`LoadExternalFirst`, `WallTile`/`ConcreteTile` repointed, new `BackdropScenes(ppu)` auto-discovering `art/bd_*.png`), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`WallTile`), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`WallPatch` + retuned tint; new `BuildScenes` furthest-back `Layer_Scenes` parallax layer @ factor 0.15, order -22, picked up by `BackdropTint`), `Assets/README.md` (credits). Gameplay/colliders/solidity matrix untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). **Live-verified in-engine** (drove the open editor: ⌘R recompile → ⌘P Play): level builds with 0 console errors; the red brick is gone (neutral dark plaster); the illustrated darkroom vignettes render on the furthest parallax layer, edge-feathered and receding into the dark — clear added depth. Bumped scene presence (alpha 0.72→0.82, colour→cooler-brighter) after a first pass read too faint, re-verified. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Backdrop track now self-serving: any `bd_*.png` dropped in `StreamingAssets/art/` is auto-placed. Next: student generates the prompt-pack hero backdrops + prop cutouts → agent chroma-keys/tints + adds an illustrated-prop near layer + code-drawn light shafts/foreground depth (the flat-box near props are the remaining weak spot vs. the new vignettes). Tunable: `BuildScenes` SceneColor/alpha/Factor, scene density. Pending: batchmode validator once editor closed.)

## Interaction 36 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~15:30
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — phase 2 (AI art integrated)
**Current Goal:** Student generated all 13 prompt-pack images (6 hero backdrops + 7 prop cutouts) and dropped them in `StreamingAssets/art/`; integrate them into the game.

### Student Prompt
"好的，全部放进去了" (generated the full set from `IMAGE_GEN_PROMPTS.md` and placed them in the art folder).

### Agent Response Summary
Inspected the 13 generations: backdrops were dark/desaturated/2:1 (followed the STYLE block) but opaque rectangles; props were good cutouts sitting on the prompted flat ~#787878 gray field. Wrote `art-pipeline/process_aigen.py`: **backdrops** → gentle desaturate + grain + rectangular edge-feather to alpha (dissolve into the dark); **props** → border-seeded flood-fill chroma-key of the gray (interior greys survive), 1px erode + soft matte, desaturate ~40% + faint-cool tint, autocrop to the matte. Raw generations archived to `_aigen_raw/`. The 6 AI backdrops now ride the same auto-discovered `Layer_Scenes` as the PD vignettes (10 scenes total). Added an illustrated **prop layer**: new `PixelArt.BackdropProps(ppu)` (auto-discovers `art/prop_*.png`, bottom-centre pivot) + `BackdropBuilder.BuildProps` ("Layer_Props", parallax 0.34, order -10) — floor props stand on a baseline, "hanging" props (prints/clock/cables, by name) drop from a ceiling line, each scaled to a target world height from its sprite bounds; picked up by `BackdropTint`. Refactored `LoadExternal` to take a pivot (overload; default unchanged). Dimmed the now-secondary box decor (Near layer lo/hi ↓ ~33%) so the illustrated art leads.

### Development Action
Integrated all student AI art: post-processed (feather + chroma-key + palette tint), auto-loaded the backdrops, built a new illustrated-prop parallax layer, and demoted the flat-box decor.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `art-pipeline/process_aigen.py`; `art/bd_{drying_line,wet_bench,enlarger_row,chem_shelf,window_shaft,safelight_corner}.png` + `art/prop_{enlarger,bottles,hanging_prints,tray_stack,reel_tank,clock,cables}.png` (processed in place). Edited: `Core/PixelArt.cs` (`LoadExternal` pivot overload, new `BackdropProps`), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildProps` + call; Near decor dimmed), `Assets/README.md` (AI-art credits). Gameplay/colliders untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). **Live-verified in-engine** (drove the editor ⌘R→⌘P over several Play sessions, 0 console errors): AI backdrops blend feathered on the far layer; `prop_enlarger` et al. stand on the floor as clean transparent cutouts (no gray halo) with their safelight-red glow; dimmed boxes recede so the illustrated art reads as the scene. A clear, large jump in richness over the old flat-box backdrop. Left Unity in Play mode (System Settings kept stealing focus, blocking the exit-Play keypress — benign; Stop with the Play button). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Optional polish remaining: code-drawn light shafts + dust in the lamp pools + a foreground depth layer; per-prop placement/scale tuning (`BuildProps`); could thin/retire the remaining box decor entirely now that illustrated props exist. Tunables called out in `BuildProps`/`BuildScenes`. Pending: batchmode validator once editor closed.)

## Interaction 37 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~15:40
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — phase 2 design-correction
**Current Goal:** Student flagged that the standalone illustrated props read as interactive objects but aren't — wrong affordance in an interaction-driven game.

### Student Prompt
"这些 prop(clock, cables 等)出现的有点奇怪，背景应该是一片一片的，就像其他 bg 一样，突然出现道具，但又不能交互只作为一个贴图不合适吧" (props pop in as discrete objects; the background should read as cohesive patches like the bg scenes; a non-interactive prop sprite is misleading). Chosen fix: **remove the standalone props**.

### Agent Response Summary
Agreed — in a game whose core read is "lit = solid / interact", a crisp standalone prop standing in the play space signals "interactable" and misleads; the large dim `bd_*` background patches don't, because they read unambiguously as the room behind. The `bd_*` backdrops already depict enlargers/bottles/trays *in context*, so the darkroom objects live there. Removed the entire standalone prop layer: deleted `BackdropBuilder.BuildProps` (+ its call) and `PixelArt.BackdropProps`, and reverted the `LoadExternal` pivot overload back to the single original (the bottom-pivot was only for props). Moved the seven processed `art/prop_*.png` out to `art-pipeline/_props_removed/` (preserved, just not loaded) and cleared their `.meta`. Kept the Near-decor dim (bg scenes still lead). Backdrops + walls untouched.

### Development Action
Removed the standalone illustrated-prop layer (affordance fix); the cohesive `bd_*` background patches carry the darkroom objects instead.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (removed `BuildProps` + call; Near comment), `Core/PixelArt.cs` (removed `BackdropProps`; reverted `LoadExternal` to single non-pivot form), `Assets/README.md` (documented why props are excluded). Moved `art/prop_*.png` → `art-pipeline/_props_removed/`. Backdrops/walls/gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). `art/` now holds only the 10 `bd_*` backdrop scenes + 3 walls. Not re-verified in-engine this round (pure removal; editor focus was being stolen by System Settings). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Backdrops remain the illustrated layer. If richer foreground objects are wanted later WITHOUT the affordance trap: composite props INTO the dim bg patches in the pipeline (so they're never separable sprites), or push them to far-background depth/dimness. Optional: light shafts + dust + foreground depth pass. Pending: ⌘R+⌘P re-verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 38 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~15:55
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — atmosphere pass
**Current Goal:** Cinematic atmosphere polish (student asked to proceed with "the atmosphere pass").

### Student Prompt
"我 confirm 了这些没了，下一步做啥，the atmosphere pass 吗" (confirmed props removed in-engine; ready for the atmosphere pass).

### Agent Response Summary
Chose the readability-safe, affordance-safe enhancement: make the EXISTING lamp light cones read as volumetric god-ray beams rather than add new free-floating objects (which would re-introduce the "looks interactive" problem). In `BackdropBuilder.Lamp`: added (1) a longer, fainter `LightCone` shaft below the bright core (warm, α0.42, order -6) — the cone sprite self-fades toward its base so it dies before the floor even on the low corridor lamps; (2) dust adrift in the beam via the existing pooled `Drift` component (5 motes, warm, slow downward, additive, order -4) — the classic "light catching dust" cue, unambiguously atmosphere. Built on the existing `Drift`/`DustMotes`/`LightCone` rather than new art. Per a new standing preference, did NOT drive the editor to verify — handed off to the student (csc-checked only).

### Development Action
Volumetric lamp beams + in-beam dust (atmosphere pass), built on existing components; no new free-floating objects.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`Lamp` — long faint shaft + `Drift` beam dust). No new files. Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Not driven in-engine by the agent (student now self-verifies — see memory `darkroom-verify-workflow`). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P check. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(If they want more: a cold downward shaft / high-window god-ray in a few background spots; a faint floor-haze band; or finally retiring the dimmed box decor in favour of more bg patches. Tunables: beam scale/α, `Drift` count/size/colour in `Lamp`. Pending: in-engine verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 39 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~16:10
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — beam redesign
**Current Goal:** Student found the new lamp beam unnatural/monotonous, saw a "fades then re-brightens past a cover" artifact and a beam with no obvious source.

### Student Prompt
"这个光束还是有些不自然，感觉比较单调，有没有更自然的光束模拟，以及会感觉下方的光束发出来变淡，然后穿过了一个掩体反而变亮了？是不是应该把光源做的更明白" (beam looks unnatural/flat; a lower beam fades then brightens after passing a cover; make the light source clearer).

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed: the Interaction-38 design stacked TWO `LightCone` sprites of different widths/heights, so (a) the beam read as two disconnected cones (the long faint one looked sourceless), and (b) where the long faint cone overlapped the dim box decor it appeared to "re-brighten past a cover"; the cone sprite itself is a flat hard gradient ("monotonous"). Rewrote it as ONE natural beam: new `PixelArt.LightBeam` — hot-spot at the source, a brighter inner core, gaussian-feathered soft edges (not a hard cone), gentle widening, smooth fade to nothing along its length (so it dies above the floor and can't reappear past a platform/box). In `Lamp`: dropped the double-cone, added a clear HDR `SoftGlow` source orb at the bulb (so the eye reads where light originates), one `LightBeam`, kept the in-beam `Drift` dust. Verified the sprite OFFLINE by replicating the formula in Python (`_preview_beam.png`) — reads as a glowing bulb with a soft shaft, source clear, smooth fade. `LightCone` now unused but left defined.

### Development Action
Replaced the hard double-cone lamp beam with a single soft volumetric `LightBeam` + a clear glowing source orb; fixes the unnatural look, the re-brighten artifact, and the unclear source.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Core/PixelArt.cs` (new `LightBeam` sprite), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`Lamp` — source glow + single beam, dust retuned). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Beam previewed offline (formula replicated in Python): natural soft shaft, clear source, no double-cone, smooth fade. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P in-engine check. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tune in `Lamp`: beam scale (length/width), `SoftGlow` source size/HDR, `LightBeam` constants (`halfW` lerp = spread, the `*24` hot-spot, `0.62` overall α). Optional still: cold god-ray, floor haze, retire box decor. Pending: in-engine verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 40 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-16 ~16:25
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — lamp height vs. camera
**Current Goal:** In the early (low) rooms only the beam *tail* is visible — the lamp/source is above the camera frame; later (higher) rooms are fine.

### Student Prompt
"因为关卡有上下，所以之后的几关没问题，但是刚开始的几关看见的灯就有限，只有光束的末端能看见" (level has vertical variation; later rooms fine, but early rooms only show the tail of the beam — the lamp is off-frame).

### Agent Response Summary
Root cause: lamps were pinned at a uniform high Y (~10.6 + jitter), but `CameraFollow` clamps the camera centre to the player's Y (MinY −1 / MaxY 9) and the camera is ortho 5.5 — so in the floor-Y≈0 early rooms the view top is ≈6 and the bulb at ≈8.6 sat off-screen; only the beam tail dipped in. Later rooms (floor Y≈3-4.5) climb up to the lamps, so they read fine. Fix: hang each main-loop lamp a fixed clearance above the LOCAL floor instead of a fixed Y. Added `BackdropBuilder.FloorTopAt(x)` which reads `LevelData.Rooms` (StaticGround boxes, skipping thin walls w<3 and high ceilings top>7, taking the max covering top at x; fallback 0.5), and set lamp top = `FloorTopAt(x) + 5.8 + rng*1.0`. Hand-checked: floor-top 0.5→bulb ≈4.3 (under view-top ≈6); floor 3.5→bulb ≈7.3; floor 4.5→bulb ≈8.3 — all in frame. Left the two manual low corridor lamps (Room 9) as-is.

### Development Action
Lamps now hang a consistent clearance above the local floor (data-driven), so the bulb/source is in the camera frame in every room — not just the high ones.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildLamps` floor-relative Y + new `FloorTopAt(x)` reading `LevelData`). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Geometry hand-verified against camera ortho 5.5 + MinY/MaxY clamp. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P check across the early rooms. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(If a specific lamp still sits too high/low, tune the `5.8` clearance / `1.0` jitter in `BuildLamps`, or the `7f` ceiling cutoff / `3f` wall cutoff in `FloorTopAt`. Optional still: cold god-ray, floor haze, retire box decor. Pending: in-engine verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

## Interaction 41 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~00:10
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — backdrop prominence
**Current Goal:** Student feels the background scenes still aren't prominent enough; asked whether laying them bigger would help.

### Student Prompt
"背景的图片感觉还是不够明显，如果铺的大一点会更好吗？" (the bg images still aren't prominent enough — would bigger help?).

### Agent Response Summary
Yes — "prominent" = size + opacity + density, so pushed all three in `BuildScenes`: load ppu 130→98 (the ~1774px hero backdrops now span ~18u, wider than the ~19.5u view → they fill the wall instead of sitting as small pockets), scale 0.85–1.4→1.0–1.45, step 28–52→20–36 (denser, fewer dark gaps), α 0.82→0.92 + colour 0.92→0.97 (a touch brighter/more opaque), y-centre 4.4–6.8→4.8–7.0. Flagged the second lever for later (the bd_* images are intrinsically dark ~mean-25; if size still isn't enough I can brightness-lift the actual images in the pipeline), but left that until the student sees the size change.

### Development Action
Backdrop scenes made bigger + denser + more opaque so they read as a present darkroom wall.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildScenes` ppu/scale/step/α/y). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P check. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Knobs in `BuildScenes`: ppu (size — lower = bigger), step (density), α/colour (opacity). If still too dim, next lever = brighten the bd_* PNGs themselves via `process_aigen.py`/`gen_backdrops.py`. Pending: in-engine verify.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 42 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~00:35
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — layer audit + retire box decor
**Current Goal:** A black block occludes the backdrop photo (screenshot 2); the background boxes look samey; student asked to investigate the cause + the full layer sorting.

### Student Prompt
"有些方块，路径感觉没什么设计，尤其是亮起来的时候尤为突兀。而且背景的方块也是差不多的设计和亮度，然后第二张截图里的照片背景会被一个黑色的方块挡住，感觉奇奇怪怪的，调查一下是什么以及各个图层排序" (gameplay platforms look undesigned + jarring when lit; the background boxes are samey; a black block occludes the photo; investigate + audit layer sorting).

### Agent Response Summary
Audited every `sortingOrder` (single default sorting layer). Back→front: `Layer_Scenes` −22 (the bd_* photos, BACKMOST) → Far `WallPatch` −18 / Far decor −16 → Near `WallPatch` −14 / Near decor −12 → lamps/beam/dust −6…−4 → exposure objects 8–15 → ground 20 → sensor 22 → stroke 30 → enemy 40 → pickup 45 → player 50 → HUD 100. Diagnosis of the "black block": the backdrop scenes are at the very back, so everything draws over them; the procedural box decor — especially **`WallPatch`** (a 6–12 × 4–8u near-black plaster rectangle, unlit GlowMat ~0.07) — sits at −18/−14 and, now that the scenes are big+bright, reads as a black rectangle punched over the photo. (In Normal the gameplay platforms are LIT and visible, so they're not the black block; the culprit is the unlit decor.) Same root cause as "background 方块 are samey" — that whole layer is now redundant (the scenes already depict shelves/enlargers/bottles) and harmful (occluding). Fix: **retired the entire box-decor system** — rewrote `BackdropBuilder` to drop both `BuildLayer` calls and all the orphaned helpers (`BuildLayer`, `WallPatch`, `PipeRun`, `CrateStack`, `Chain`, `Barrel`, `HangingLine`, `Shelf`, `Enlarger`, `Decor`, `Range`, `Tint`, fields `_layer/_rng/_lo/_hi`). Kept `BuildScenes`, `BuildLamps`, `FloorTopAt`, `Lamp`, `Decoration`. The scenes + lamps now carry the backdrop. `WallTile`/`ConcreteTile` confirmed still used by gameplay (`LevelBuilder`), so not orphaned. The gameplay-platform complaint (undesigned/jarring-when-lit) is left as a separate proposal (it's gameplay-readability-sensitive — not changed unilaterally).

### Development Action
Audited layer sorting; identified the occluding "black block" as the unlit box decor (WallPatch); retired the whole box-decor layer so the illustrated scenes read unobstructed.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Rewrote `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (removed box-decor layers + ~12 orphaned helpers/fields; scenes + lamps only). Gameplay/colliders untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P check (backdrops should now read unobstructed; no black rectangles over the photos). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Open item: the gameplay platforms (StaticGround, lit ConcreteTile/WallTile) look plain + pop bright when lit/OVER. Options to propose: tone down their lit brightness, add edge/rim definition, or a more characterful floor texture — all readability-sensitive, so confirm direction first. Also: if the mid-ground now feels empty without box decor, add a NEW thin non-occluding silhouette layer (rafters/pipes high up). Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 43 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~01:05
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — platform "lit lip" (B+A) + adversarial review
**Current Goal:** Student approved "B+A" — give the gameplay platforms a defined lit edge (B) + tone down the lit pop (A).

### Student Prompt
"Yeah sure, B+A"

### Agent Response Summary
Implemented B+A in `LevelBuilder.Box` (StaticGround): **A** = darkened face (tall 0.26→0.185, flat 0.30→0.205) so it stays calm when lit/OVER; **B** = a "lit lip" — new `PixelArt.EdgeFade` vertical-gradient rim that bleeds down from the top edge + a brighter core catch-light on top, so platforms read as 3D ledges. Previewed offline (`_preview_platform.png`) vs the old flat slab. Then — per ultracode — ran a 13-agent adversarial review workflow. It confirmed **two real bugs I introduced**: (1) HIGH — the lip was on `GlowMat` (UNLIT), so it stayed full-bright in UNDER and traced the geometry, violating the spec "geometry hard to read in UNDER" (the old edge was on the LIT material and dimmed naturally); (2) MEDIUM — `EdgeFade` was authored 8×64 @ ppu 64, native width only 0.125u, so the rim rendered as a thin central streak, not full width. Fixed both: new `World/PlatformLip.cs` (+hand-made meta) gates the lip alpha → 0.10 in UNDER (keeps the GlowMat bloom in Normal/Over, hides it in UNDER); `EdgeFade` → 64×64 @ ppu 64 (native 1×1) so `localScale (s.x, rimH)` spans the full top. Low-severity findings (lip on non-walkable ceilings/walls; width<1 platforms get face-but-no-lip) are PRE-EXISTING and deferred. Colliders/sizes/solidity untouched throughout.

### Development Action
Platform lit-lip (darker face + rim-falloff + core edge); adversarially reviewed; fixed the UNDER-leak (exposure-gated lip) and the rim-width sprite bug it surfaced.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `World/PlatformLip.cs` (+meta). Edited: `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (StaticGround face darken + EdgeRim/EdgeLight lip + `PlatformLip.Bind`), `Core/PixelArt.cs` (new `EdgeFade` sprite, fixed to 1×1 native). Gameplay/colliders/solidity untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Adversarial review (13 agents) found 2 real bugs → both fixed; remaining findings pre-existing/deferred. Lip now: full soft-bloom lip in Normal/Over, ~10% in UNDER (geometry stays hidden); rim spans full platform width. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P (check NORMAL/OVER ledges look designed AND that UNDER still hides geometry). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables: face colour (LevelBuilder StaticGround), lip `rsr`/`esr` colour+α, `PlatformLip.UnderMul` (0.10 = how hidden in UNDER), rim height `Min(0.55, s.y*0.6)`. Deferred-low: gate lip on walkability; lip for width<1 platforms. Pending: in-engine verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

## Interaction 44 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~12:15
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — mid-ground depth layer (plan-mode)
**Current Goal:** Removing the box decor left a parallax gap between the far photos (0.15) and gameplay (1.0); student wants a properly-designed thematic mid-ground that coordinates with the photos, lamps, and path.

### Student Prompt
"给中景补一点纵深，但是好好重新设计一下，思考根据这些主题应该加入什么元素，以及和背景图片，吊灯，走的路这些怎么配合，也可适当根据安排对背景图片再调整" (add mid-ground depth, properly redesigned, thematic, coordinating with the bg photos / lamps / path; may adjust the bg photos too).

### Agent Response Summary
Ran the plan-mode workflow: 2 Explore agents mapped the layering (sort orders, parallax, per-room floor profile, camera framing, art helpers, BackdropTint scope) + the removed box-decor patterns; 1 Plan agent validated/refined the design. Approved plan → implemented a new `BuildMidground` in `BackdropBuilder.cs`: a `MidGround` child (NOT `Layer_*`, so BackdropTint leaves it a **constant dark silhouette** that stays dark even against the warm-bright Over wall), `ParallaxLayer.Factor 0.30` (mid-depth), all parts at sortingOrder **-10** (in front of photos -22, behind lamps -6..-4 so the lamp beams composite over the clutter, behind gameplay). Walks x like the lamps, ~60% density, anchored at `FloorTopAt(x)+4.8` (ceiling band) hanging DOWN, skipping the room-9 corridor sentinel so clutter doesn't float off-screen. Three thematic cluster types: **DryingLine** (catenary wire via 4 straight segments + a `WireSeg` rotate helper, with hanging prints + rotated `ProcGfx.FilmStripTile` film negatives — echoes bd_drying_line.png), **PipeRun** (pipe + brackets + elbow drop), **SafelightFixture** (cord + housing + a faint RED `SoftGlow`, value<1 so it does NOT bloom — the darkroom-red accent beside the warm lamps + an optional hanging reel). New unlit `Part()` helper reuses `Decoration` but swaps to GlowMat; no Light2D/Drift on clutter (static, batches). Offline mock (`_preview_midground.png`) confirms the silhouettes read as darkroom clutter. Per the gated plan, did NOT pre-brighten the bd_* photos (the new contrast should suffice; HILIGHT lever reserved).

### Development Action
Added a mid-depth "hanging darkroom clutter" silhouette layer (drying lines + pipes + red safelights) between the far photos and the lamps.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (new `BuildMidground` + `Part`/`WireSeg`/`DryingLine`/`PipeRun`/`SafelightFixture`; wired into `Build()`). Reused `Decoration`/`FloorTopAt`, `ProcGfx.FilmStripTile`, `PixelArt.SoftGlow/Disc`, `VisualFactory.WhiteSprite/GlowMat`. Gameplay/colliders untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Offline mock confirms thematic read. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P across rooms 0/4/9/10 + all 3 exposures (depth present in upper frame; path never blocked; stays dark in Under/Normal/Over while beams composite over it; red safelight glows without blooming). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables in `BackdropBuilder`: `ClutterDark` value (0.12), density (0.60) + spacing (14–22), height anchor (+4.8), element mix (50/30/20), safelight glow α (0.5). If too sparse → raise density/lower spacing; if far wall reads muddy behind it → raise `HILIGHT` in gen_backdrops.py (gated follow-up). Pending: in-engine verify; batchmode validator once editor closed.)

## Interaction 45 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~12:35
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — mid-ground visibility fix
**Current Goal:** Student couldn't see the new mid-ground clutter at all; asked to check whether it generated correctly.

### Student Prompt
"我感觉都看不到啊，查一查生成对了吗" (I can't see it at all — check whether it's generated correctly).

### Agent Response Summary
Generation logic was correct (compiles, placement sound) — the problem was **visibility from sparsity × parallax compression**. Simulated the x-walk + parallax in Python: with the shipped settings (spacing 14–22, density 0.60, Factor 0.30) seed 313 spawned only **3 clusters for the whole level**, and ~**52% of camera positions saw nothing** (parallax Factor 0.30 means a cluster's visible window sweeps `0.70·camX`, so only ~4 of the already-few clusters are ever in frame). Combined with the very dark `ClutterDark` 0.12 and a high `+4.8` anchor, it read as invisible. Fix (no logic change): density up (spacing 14–22→8–13, gate 0.60→0.85 → ~10–12 clusters), parallax Factor 0.30→0.40 (less compression, denser coverage), `ClutterDark` 0.12→0.22 (survives ACES+contrast, reads against the backdrop), anchor +4.8→+4.2 (a touch lower into frame). Re-simulated: ~10–12 clusters, something visible ~95–100% of the time.

### Development Action
Fixed mid-ground invisibility: denser placement + less parallax compression + brighter silhouettes.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildMidground` Factor/gate/spacing/anchor; `ClutterDark` value). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0). Python sim confirms ~10–12 clusters and ~98% of camera positions now have clutter in view. Awaiting student ⌘R(refresh)+⌘P. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Likely just-right now; if still too sparse/dense, the levers are gate (0.85) + spacing (8–13); brightness `ClutterDark` (0.22). NOTE: must ⌘R before ⌘P — C# changed, else stale assembly. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 46 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~13:00
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — AI mid-ground clutter pipeline
**Current Goal:** Student finds the code-drawn mid-ground silhouettes crude and wants more variety + higher quality, via AI-gen / web images.

### Student Prompt
"看到了，但还是不够丰富，还能设计什么，以及这个杂物还是略显简陋，要不也采用 AI 生成或者网上找图的办法？" (visible now, but not rich enough + the clutter looks crude — what else to design, and maybe use AI-gen / web images?).

### Agent Response Summary
Noted the key affordance distinction: unlike the retired floor props, the mid-ground hangs high behind gameplay, so detailed AI art is safe here (won't read as interactable). Web CC0 "hanging darkroom clutter" cutouts are scarce → recommended AI-gen, same pipeline as the backdrops. Delivered: (1) `art-pipeline/MIDGROUND_PROMPTS.md` — a 10-item prompt pack (drying prints, drying negatives, pipes, vent/fan, safelight, reels, cables, high shelf, tongs rack, clock) on flat-gray bg, composed to hang from the TOP of the frame. (2) Integration: re-added the `LoadExternal` pivot overload; new `PixelArt.MidgroundClutter(ppu)` auto-discovers `art/mid_*.png` at TOP-centre pivot; `BackdropBuilder.BuildMidground` now prefers an illustrated cutout (`ClutterArt`, hung from the ceiling band, top-pivot, darkened tint, scaled from bounds) ~75% of the time when any exist, mixing in code silhouettes (`ClutterCode`) for variety, and falls back to all-code when none. (3) `process_aigen.py` gained a `process_mid` branch (chroma-key OR use existing alpha; heavy-desaturate + DARKEN to a dim silhouette-with-detail; idempotent — reads from `_aigen_raw/`) + auto-detects `mid_*.png`; also hardened the script (process_backdrop now reads from raw too; props loop dropped since props were retired; montage globs bd_*/mid_*). So dropping `mid_*.png` into `art/` auto-hangs them; code silhouettes remain the fallback.

### Development Action
Stood up the AI mid-ground-clutter path: prompt pack + auto-loading cutout layer (code silhouettes as fallback) + a hardened, idempotent processing branch.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `art-pipeline/MIDGROUND_PROMPTS.md`. Edited: `Core/PixelArt.cs` (LoadExternal pivot overload + `MidgroundClutter` loader), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildMidground` prefers cutouts; `ClutterArt`/`ClutterCode` split), `art-pipeline/process_aigen.py` (`process_mid` + idempotency + retired-props cleanup). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0); `process_aigen.py` parses; raw backups confirmed for idempotent re-runs. Awaiting student to generate `mid_*.png` from the prompt pack → drop in `art/` → (process if gray-bg) → ⌘R+⌘P. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Student generates mid_* from MIDGROUND_PROMPTS.md → art/. If gray-bg, run `python art-pipeline/process_aigen.py` (chroma-keys + darkens just the mid_*). Tunables: `ClutterArt` targetH/anchor/tint, the 0.75 cutout-vs-code mix; `process_mid` darken factor (0.5). Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 47 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~13:20
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — mid-ground cutouts processed
**Current Goal:** Student generated all 10 `mid_*.png` (on gray bg) and asked to chroma-key them to transparent.

### Student Prompt
"我都生成完了，但是可能得去一下灰色背景变为纯png" (generated all of them, but the gray background needs removing → transparent PNG).

### Agent Response Summary
Confirmed all 10 `mid_*.png` present, all on the prompted ~#787878 flat-gray field (opaque RGB, 1024–1536px). Ran `process_aigen.py` → its `process_mid` branch chroma-keyed the gray to alpha, desaturated + darkened + autocropped each to the content (raw originals backed up to `_aigen_raw/`, so re-runs are idempotent). First pass came out a touch too dark for "rich", so lightened the `process_mid` darken (×0.5→×0.64) + kept a bit more colour (desat 0.68→0.55) and re-ran. Built a dedicated mid preview composited on the game bg (`_preview_mid.png`): all 10 read as clean, transparent, dim-but-detailed darkroom clutter — cables, clock, negatives, prints, pipes, reels, the red safelight (red dome survived), shelf, tongs rack, vent. They now auto-hang on `MidGround` via the loader built in Interaction 46. Documented in `Assets/README.md` credits.

### Development Action
Processed the 10 student-generated mid-ground cutouts (chroma-key + tone) → transparent hanging clutter the game auto-loads; tuned the darkness for readable detail.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Processed in place: `art/mid_*.png` (10). Edited: `art-pipeline/process_aigen.py` (`process_mid` darken tune), `Assets/README.md` (credits). No C# change this step (loader landed in I46). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
All 10 chroma-keyed transparent + toned; preview confirms clean mattes + readable detail. Awaiting student ⌘R(refresh — the I46 loader C# is new)+⌘P to see them hanging in-engine. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(If too dark/light in-engine → `process_mid` darken (0.64) or `ClutterArt` colour (0.82); if too big/small → `ClutterArt` targetH; size/density via the I45/I46 knobs. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 48 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~13:40
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — mid-ground density up
**Current Goal:** With cutouts in, the mid-ground still only shows ~1–2 at a time as it parallax-scrolls; student wants more visible at once.

### Student Prompt
"有点问题啊，这些中景都会随着人物动对吧，所以始终只有一两样能看见" (the mid-ground scrolls with the player, so only ever 1–2 are visible).

### Agent Response Summary
Correct diagnosis: the parallax Factor only changes how fast the layer scrolls, NOT how many sit in the view window — that's purely density. Python sim confirmed the shipped settings (spacing 8–13, gate 0.85) give avg ~1.6 visible (max 2–3). Bumped density: spacing 8–13→4–7, gate 0.85→0.94 (sim → avg ~3, up to 5, never empty). Also **widened the height band** (cutouts floor+5.7±0.6 → +4.9±1.6; code +4.2±0.8 → +3.6±1.6) so they don't form a flat row, and **shrank the cutouts** (targetH 1.7–3.4 → 1.5–2.9) so the denser packing doesn't overlap into mush. Lots more on screen, varied heights, still behind gameplay.

### Development Action
Raised mid-ground density (~1.6→~3 visible at once) + varied heights + slightly smaller cutouts.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildMidground` gate/spacing; `ClutterArt` targetH/height; `ClutterCode` height). Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0); sim confirms ~3 visible at once across seeds. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Density knobs: gate (0.94) + spacing (4–7) in `BuildMidground`. If now too busy → lower gate / widen spacing. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 49 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~14:10
**Development Stage:** Illustrated environment uplift (Milestone 13) — mid-ground vertical-follow (root-cause fix)
**Current Goal:** Student's editor screenshot shows most clutter hanging OUTSIDE the play camera's frame; wants a thorough fix.

### Student Prompt
"我截了编辑器的屏给你看一下现在的布局，大部分东西还是悬挂在可视范围之外，彻底想一个改进的办法" (most clutter hangs outside the visible range — think of a thorough fix).

### Agent Response Summary
Root cause (not density): the clutter was pinned to the WORLD floor (`FloorTopAt(x)+clearance`), but `CameraFollow` tracks the player's Y, so as the player climbs/drops the fixed band drifts out of frame — and unlike the tall backdrops, the small clutter falls out easily. Fix: extended `ParallaxLayer` with `VerticalFollow` (+`VerticalOffset`) so a layer can TRACK the camera's Y; `BuildMidground` now sets VerticalFollow 0.85 / Offset 4.5 (the band hangs from the upper view and follows the camera with mild vertical parallax) and places clutter in a small LOCAL band (`y = -[0,1.6]`) instead of floor-anchored. Dropped the now-moot FloorTopAt corridor skip. Verified by formula across camY −1..9: clutter top stays +3.1..+4.7 above the view centre, bottom +0.3..+1.8 — always in the upper-middle, never off-frame, hanging above the player everywhere. Scene/Layer_Scenes keep VerticalFollow 0 (unchanged).

### Development Action
Made the mid-ground track the camera vertically (root-cause fix) so it stays in the upper frame as the player moves up/down; clutter now placed in a camera-relative band, not floor-anchored.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `World/ParallaxLayer.cs` (VerticalFollow/VerticalOffset), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (`BuildMidground` vertical-follow + local-Y placement; `ClutterArt`/`ClutterCode` take a local y). `FloorTopAt` still used by lamps. Gameplay untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (exit 0); formula confirms the band is in the upper-middle of the view for all camera heights. Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P (clutter should now stay above the player in every room/jump). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables in `BuildMidground`: `VerticalOffset` (4.5 = how high it hangs), `VerticalFollow` (0.85 = how strictly it tracks the camera — lower = more world-anchored but risks drifting out). Density gate/spacing as before. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 50 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~15:40
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — tutorial de-load + light-trail learning arc
**Current Goal:** Front-loaded teaching: the first ~3 min (rooms 0–3) dump 7 mechanics + a wall of text. Student wants gradual, discover-it-yourself pacing — one verb at a time — and specifically a re-sequenced light-trail arc.

### Student Prompt
"审核一下关卡设计，现在文字太多，我更想做成循序渐进引导用户自己探索，一个一个功能慢慢掌握… 花光轨可以留到进程一半以后… 10 关还是 11 关那个 under 模式下展示光轨可以挪到前面去，先让用户知道有光轨这个玩意，再去学自己画，以及画更复杂的光轨" (too much text; want gradual one-at-a-time discovery; move drawing-light-trails to past halfway; move the room-10 UNDER trail demo to the front — see a trail, then learn to draw, then draw complex ones).

### Agent Response Summary
Reviewed the 11-room curve (3 Explore + 2 Plan agents). Diagnosis: drawing (Shutter) was the **4th** verb taught (Room 3), while the pre-authored glowing DarkTrail demo sat unused until Room 10 — the exact reverse of the student's "see → draw simple → draw complex" intent; plus banners/cards/hints stacked and hints were full-paragraph lectures. Confirmed via code that ability-gating is **pickup-order driven**, so re-sequencing = moving `PickupDef`s + re-theming room content, no gating-code change. Asked 2 scoping questions → chose **trim+dedup (stable)** text pass and **Room 5 (midpoint)** for the drawing debut. Implemented a 3-stage trail arc: **R1 "THE LONG EXPOSURE"** now SHOWS a glowing trail (pre-authored `DarkTrail`, walk it in UNDER, zero skill); **R3 "WHAT THE LIGHT SKIPPED"** reinforces reading the dark (a hidden DarkPath staircase, replacing the old draw-gated climb block); **R5 "FIRST STROKE"** is the Shutter debut (draw one bridge, watcher parked off the launch perch). R10's trail stays as the familiar callback. Hard dependency handled: the old `R3_ClimbBlock` bridged R3's low floor up to R4's high floor over a void, so its removal needed a replacement climb — the dark staircase serves it. Text: trimmed the wordiest hints in R0/R2/R4/R6/R8/R9/R10 to ≤70 chars (auto-shrinks the bubble) and added a HUD guard so only **one** teaching prompt shows at a time (a hint defers behind an active pickup banner; the exposure card won't pop over a hint), linger 6s→2.5s, controls block retires at x>73 (after the drawing lesson) instead of x>42.

### Development Action
Re-sequenced the light-trail learning arc (see early in R1 → draw simple in R5 → complex in R10), moved the Shutter pickup R3→R5, re-themed R3 as a non-drawing dark-staircase climb, trimmed tutorial text, and serialized early-room prompts so they no longer stack.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelData.cs` (R1 trail demo + retheme; R3 dark-staircase retheme, removed `R3_ClimbBlock` + moved Shutter out; R5 Shutter pickup + enemy relocated to far ledge + retheme; hint trims in R0/R2/R4/R6/R8/R9/R10 — net hints 19→18). Edited `UI/HUDController.cs` (one-prompt-at-a-time guard via `_hintDeferCo`/`ShowHintAfterBanner`/`ShowHintNow`; `ShowCard` skips while a hint bubble is up; hint linger 6→2.5s; controls-retire threshold 42→73; Shutter banner shortened). Gating/builder code untouched (pickup-order driven). Editor `DarkroomValidator.cs` left as-is — already stale (asserts DarkPath==11 vs actual 8, refs non-existent `R8_BarrierCeiling`, build-count ignores trails/lifts/umbrals); my change happens to make its hints==18 assertion correct again.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Key things to verify in-engine: (1) R3 dark staircase is comfortably jumpable in UNDER and lands cleanly onto R4's floor (3 hops ~1.1 up each over the void — the one geometry risk); (2) R1 glowing trail is walkable end-to-end in UNDER and reads as "a light-trail exists"; (3) R5 Shutter pickup is collected on the perch and the perch→far-ledge gap rewards a drawn bridge; (4) early-room prompts no longer overlap. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables: R3 step heights/spacing in `LevelData.cs` if the climb feels too far; R5 pickup at (63.5,7.4) and the far-ledge enemy (71.5,7.9,range0.8) if the first draw feels pressured — push the enemy right / lower its range. Hint linger 2.5s and the `x>73` controls cutoff in `HUDController`. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 51 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~16:05
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R5 first-draw made mandatory
**Current Goal:** Student flagged that the new R5 drawing gap is skippable by just jumping it, so the first-draw lesson isn't actually taught.

### Student Prompt
"R5 那个会太容易跳过去" (the R5 one is too easy to jump over).

### Agent Response Summary
Correct. Read the actual physics (`PlayerController`): `JumpForce 12.5`, `gravityScale 3.2` → apex height = 12.5²/(2·31.4) ≈ **2.49**, horizontal range ≈ 5.6 (matches the level comments). The original R5 gap (perch top 6.75 → far ledge 7.5, 3.2 wide) was trivially jumpable. Key realization: a **horizontal** gap can NEVER force drawing here — a drawn stroke rides the same jump arc, so any gap you can't jump you also can't one-stroke-bridge. The deterministic lever is **vertical**: a ledge higher than the 2.49 apex is un-jumpable regardless of run-up. Rebuilt R5 as a vertical climb (the proven mechanic the old Room-3 climb block used, which was +3.0): replaced the narrow perch with a **wide low pad** (`R5_Pad` top 4.5, x60-66 — forgiving landing off the burnt gate) and **kept the far ledge at top 7.5 = +3.0 above the pad**. Verified un-jumpable: max feet height from the pad = 4.5+2.49 = 6.99 < 7.5 (falls ~0.5 short from any launch point), so one drawn step near the jump apex is required, then a small hop up. Far ledge stays 7.5 → R6 transition unchanged. Also moved **CP_R5 onto the pad** (62,5.4), past the gate, so a failed stroke retries instantly instead of re-burning the gate; Shutter pickup + enemy relocated to suit. Hint/objective reworded ("Too high to jump — draw a step in the air, then climb").

### Development Action
Reworked R5 from a (skippable) horizontal bridge into a vertical climb that is provably un-jumpable (+3.0 > 2.49 apex), forcing the first drawn step; moved the checkpoint onto the pad for instant retries.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelData.cs` (R5 only: `R5_EnemyPerch`→`R5_Pad` wide low pad; far ledge kept at +3.0; CP_R5 moved onto the pad; Shutter pickup→(64,5.4); hint/objective). No other rooms or code touched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) far ledge is genuinely un-jumpable from the pad (you fall ~0.5 short); (2) ONE drawn step near the apex makes it climbable; (3) drop off the burnt gate reliably lands on the wide pad; (4) respawn lands back on the pad, not before the gate. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables in `LevelData.cs` R5: if still jumpable, raise `R5_FarLedge` cy; if the climb feels too hard, lower the far ledge toward +2.6 or widen the pad's right edge closer to x68. Enemy (71.5,7.9) and pad width as needed. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 52 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~16:35
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R9 shadow-lift discovery un-telegraphed
**Current Goal:** The FRAME-10 (R9 "THE DROP") descent — switch to UNDER to ride the shadow lift down — gives away the lift's presence too readily; student wants discovering it to be a bit harder.

### Student Prompt
"第 10 关附近需要切成 under 过，但是这样就会太容易发现那个地方有电梯了，怎么做的更有难度一点" (near level 10 you switch to under to get through, but that makes it too easy to spot the lift is there — make it a bit harder).

### Agent Response Summary
Identified the room: FRAME 10 = R9 (`R9_ShadowLift`). Read `ShadowLift.cs` — the slab is ALREADY invisible+intangible in NORMAL/OVER (solid+visible only in UNDER, sinks only while ridden), so the lift itself isn't the leak. The three telegraphs were: (1) the hint **spelled out the whole solution** ("Press 1 — a shadow catches you and sinks down. Keep it dark."); (2) objectives "Ride the shadow down / Don't let the light in"; (3) `BuildLiftDecor` builds **always-visible shaft rails** (parented to root, shown in every mode) so the shaft reads as a lift track even in the light. Argued the discovery can lean on the learned pattern — by FRAME 10 the player has used "go dark → footing appears" ~5× (R1/R3/R6/R8) — so it can be inferred, not handed over. Stripped all three: hint → cryptic darkroom-voice inversion of R1 ("The light prints no way down." — nudges dark without naming a lift/press-1/ride); objective → vague ("Find a way down the shaft"); rails → suppressed for the shadow lift only via a new `rails` param on `BuildLiftDecor` (R4's RiseLift keeps its rails). Now the shaft reads as a plain deadly drop until the player thinks to go dark, where the shadow slab appears and sinks them down.

### Development Action
Un-telegraphed the R9 shadow-lift descent: cryptic hint, vague objective, and removed the always-visible shaft rails so the lift must be discovered by going dark rather than being announced.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelData.cs` (R9 objective + first hint). Edited `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`BuildLiftDecor` gains `bool rails=true`; `Lift()`/ShadowLift passes `rails:false`; `LightLift()`/RiseLift unchanged). ShadowLift mechanic itself untouched (already UNDER-only).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) arriving at the shaft in NORMAL, there's no rail/track hint that a lift is there — it reads as a deadly drop; (2) switching to UNDER reveals the shadow slab and rides down as before; (3) R4's light lift still shows its rails. If too obscure now → restore a softer nudge (e.g. re-add a short "the dark might" line) or bring the rails back faintly. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Dial difficulty via the R9 hint text in `LevelData.cs` and the `rails:false` flag in `LevelBuilder.Lift`. If players get stuck, the cheapest re-hint is wording, not geometry. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 53 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~17:00
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R8 hidden light bridge + R9 lift sightline
**Current Goal:** Student (with screenshot) pinned the real leak: R8 (FRAME 9) is a light-bridge-then-dark-bridge room, and crossing the DARK bridge in UNDER lets you see the R9 shadow lift ahead. Plus an explicit ask: make the LIGHT bridge invisible in NORMAL too, so the cross-here trick isn't given away by just looking.

### Student Prompt
"主要是因为第九关是一段亮的一段暗的桥，在 under 状态下过了暗的桥很容易就能看到那儿有个电梯。以及我想把亮的桥改成在normal 状态下也不可见，不然太容易发现过关技巧了" (FRAME 9 is a light/dark bridge pair; in UNDER after the dark bridge you can see the lift ahead. Also: make the light bridge invisible in NORMAL too, or the technique is too easy to spot).

### Agent Response Summary
Read `ExposureObject.TargetAlpha`: **DarkPath** (the dark bridge) is already GoneAlpha(0) in NORMAL — invisible; **BrightStroke** (the light bridge) is FadedAlpha(**0.18**) in NORMAL — a faint ghost that telegraphs "bridge here, use OVER." That 0.18 is intentional for PLAYER-drawn strokes (you want to see your own fixed strokes as ghosts), so I did NOT change the global matrix — instead remapped per-object in `LevelBuilder.LightBridge` (the level-authored bridge), exactly like `DarkTrail` does for its DarkStroke: `vis = InverseLerp(0.18,1,a)` applied to body+edge+drift → 0 in NORMAL/UNDER, 1 in OVER. Now the light bridge is a true hidden puzzle (the dark bridge already was). For the sightline root cause, added a **proximity gate to `ShadowLift`**: the slab is solid+visible only in UNDER AND within `RevealDistX=4` of the player, so from R8's dark bridge (player x ≤ 122.9, lift at 128 → dist ≥ 5.1) it stays hidden, and it materializes as the player reaches the arrival ledge (x ≈ 124+). Verified safe for the descent (rider stays at x≈128 → dist≈0 the whole way down; collider toggles instantly on `near`, so no fall-through). Flagged: since R5's light bridge was removed in the M14 re-theme, R8 is now the FIRST light bridge — it debuts as a hidden puzzle, but the R8 hint ("Bright bridge in OVER…") still scaffolds it.

### Development Action
Made R8's light bridge invisible in NORMAL (per-object remap, player strokes unaffected) and gated the R9 shadow lift to reveal only when the player is near, so it can't be seen across the gap from R8's dark bridge.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`LightBridge` OnAlphaApplied → InverseLerp remap on body/edge/drift). Edited `World/ShadowLift.cs` (added `RevealDistX=4` proximity gate to the solid/visible test; hoisted the GameManager lookup). Global exposure matrix untouched (player-drawn strokes still ghost at 0.18).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) in NORMAL the R8 light-bridge gap reads as empty (no faint ghost), reveals + turns solid only in OVER; (2) crossing R8's dark bridge in UNDER, the R9 lift is NOT visible ahead; (3) reaching the R9 shaft, the slab materializes and rides down as before; (4) drawn (player) bright strokes still ghost faintly in NORMAL. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Tunables: `RevealDistX` in `ShadowLift.cs` (4 → larger reveals it sooner, smaller hides it longer); if R8's first light bridge feels too hidden now, soften via the R8 hint wording or give the bridge a faint OVER-only shimmer. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 54 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~17:30
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R9 lift dropped below the frame at the ledge edge
**Current Goal:** Even with the proximity gate, standing at the arrival-ledge edge still shows the lift; student suggested lowering the lift further down the shaft.

### Student Prompt
"还是走到台子边就能看见，把这个电梯做的再往下一点如何" (you can still see it at the platform edge — how about making the lift a bit further down).

### Agent Response Summary
Right call, and the camera math pins the exact value: read `CameraFollow` — the camera CENTRE is clamped to `MaxY=9`. At the arrival ledge the player is at ~y10 but the camera sticks at y9, so the frame bottom is y9−5.5 = **3.5**. The lift at topY=7 (slab top 7.3) sat well inside the frame → visible at the edge. To drop it below the frame bottom, the slab top (topY+0.3) must be < 3.5 → topY < ~3.2; went to **topY=2.5** (slab top 2.8, ~0.7 below the frame bottom, so its glow clears too). Now the shaft reads as empty from the ledge; the player must commit to the dark drop, free-falls ~7 units, and the shadow rises into view to catch them partway down — which is exactly what R9's own fiction says ("step in and you fall forever… a shadow rises to catch you"). Verified safe: free-fall impact ~21 u/s, but Continuous collision + kinematic slab + 0.42 units/fixed-step < 0.6 slab height → no tunnelling; checkpoint CP_R9a is at the shaft top so a light-mode mis-drop just retries. bottomY stays −1.8 (corridor floor), proximity gate (`RevealDistX=4`) still hides it from R8.

### Development Action
Lowered the R9 shadow lift's rest position (topY 7 → 2.5) so it sits below the camera's frame bottom at the ledge edge; the descent is now a committed leap caught lower down.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelData.cs` (R9 `LiftDef` topY 7 → 2.5; updated comment with the camera-clamp rationale). No code change — `ShadowLift` proximity gate from I53 still applies.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) at the arrival-ledge edge in UNDER, the shaft reads empty — no lift/glow peeking at the frame bottom; (2) stepping off, you free-fall and the shadow catches you partway down, then sinks to the corridor; (3) the hard landing is clean (no fall-through). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Single knob: `R9_ShadowLift` topY in `LevelData.cs` — raise toward 3.2 for a shorter drop that's still just-hidden (risk: glow peeks), lower for a longer leap. Frame bottom is y3.5 because the camera clamps at MaxY=9; raising `CameraFollow.MaxY` would change this globally. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 55 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~18:00
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R10 opening beat is now player-drawn
**Current Goal:** The FRAME-11 (R10 final) opening gap was a pre-authored DarkTrail you just reveal+walk, and it's jumpable — student wants the player to DRAW that trail themselves, and the gap shouldn't be skippable.

### Student Prompt
"frame11 那里轨迹应该留着自己画，而且现在能直接跳过去不太合理" (at frame 11 the trail should be left for the player to draw, and being able to just jump across right now isn't reasonable).

### Agent Response Summary
This closes the light-trail learning arc: R1 SEE a pre-authored trail → R5 DRAW a simple one → R10 DRAW the complex capstone. So the R10 opener should be the player's own bridge, not a freebie. Removed the pre-authored `R10_DarkTrail` (the reveal-and-walk streak from the start platform up to AnchorA). Then made the gap un-jumpable: start platform top is 3.0; the player's max jump height is 2.49 (apex), so I raised `R10_AnchorA` from top 4.9 (+1.9, which was right at the jumpable edge — hence "现在能直接跳过去") to top 5.7 (**+2.7**, above the apex everywhere along the arc). Now the only way across is to draw a rising bridge/step and climb it — flexible (draw a step anywhere mid-gap, then hop up to the anchor). Verified the raise doesn't break the next beats: AnchorA→BurnA (white wall y4.9-7.9, the player at 5.7 collides with it and burns through, then drops to SensorFloor 4.5); CeilingA clearance fine (no jump from AnchorA — you burn, not jump). Updated the mnemonic hint + objective from "reveal, draw, anchor, burn" → "draw your own bridge, anchor, burn".

### Development Action
Replaced R10's pre-authored opening trail with a forced player-drawn bridge: removed `R10_DarkTrail` and raised `R10_AnchorA` past jump height so the gap can only be crossed by drawing.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Level/LevelData.cs` (R10 only: removed the `trails` array/`R10_DarkTrail`; `R10_AnchorA` cy 4.6 → 5.4 i.e. top 4.9 → 5.7; objective + first hint reworded). No code change — reuses the existing TrailSystem drawing the player already learned in R5.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) the R10 opening gap can NOT be jumped (you fall ~0.8 short); (2) drawing a bridge/step across it works and lands you on AnchorA; (3) from AnchorA you still burn BurnA and reach the sensor floor as before; (4) failed draw → respawn at CP_R10a on the start platform, quick retry. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Knob: `R10_AnchorA` cy in `LevelData.cs` — lower toward 4.9 if the draw feels too high/hard (but keep top ≥ ~5.5 so it stays un-jumpable), raise for a taller bridge. The whole light-trail arc (see→draw simple→draw complex) is now: R1 trail, R5 first stroke, R10 capstone. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 56 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-17 ~18:25
**Development Stage:** Onboarding pacing (Milestone 14) — R10 umbral now needs LIGHT, not shadow
**Current Goal:** In R10 the shade-wall mechanism opens if you draw a BLACK (dark) stroke at it — student says that's illogical (shadow shouldn't dispel shadow).

### Student Prompt
"同样是这一关，最后画一笔黑的光轨打开机关不太合理" (same level — opening the mechanism at the end by drawing a black trail isn't reasonable).

### Agent Response Summary
The "机关" is `R10_PostUmbra` (UmbralBarrier): it retracts when `LightField.SampleAt(foot) >= retractThreshold`, i.e. when LIGHT is delivered to its base — the hint even says "lay a BRIGHT stroke at its foot." Root cause in `TrailStroke.Fix()`: it registered EVERY fixed stroke as a LightField emitter regardless of type, so a dark stroke (a dark-blue point light at ~0.5 intensity) delivered ~0.5 lux > the 0.3 threshold and cleared the shade — shadow opening a shade wall. Fixed by gating the registration on `_eo.type == BrightStroke`: a dark stroke is shadow, not light, so it no longer registers as an emitter and can't clear the umbral. Confirmed safe: the only LightField consumers are UmbralBarrier and LocalLux PhotoSensors, and the shipped level has NO LocalLux sensors (R6/R10 photo sensors are both GlobalOverexposed = stand-in-OVER, not light-routed), so nothing else depended on dark strokes emitting light. The dark stroke keeps its visual glow (it's still a visible UNDER platform) — only its gameplay light contribution is removed. The intended solve (be in OVER, draw a bright stroke at the foot → clears) is unchanged.

### Development Action
Made only BRIGHT (light) strokes deliver puzzle-light, so the R10 shade wall can no longer be opened with a dark/shadow stroke — only by drawing a bright stroke, as the hint intends.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
Edited `Player/TrailStroke.cs` (`Fix()` now registers the LightField emitter only when `_eo.type == BrightStroke`). No data/geometry change; `UmbralBarrier`/`LightField` untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (COMPILE_OK). Awaiting student ⌘R+⌘P. Verify: (1) drawing a DARK stroke at the R10 shade wall does NOT open it; (2) drawing a BRIGHT stroke (in OVER) at its foot DOES clear it as before; (3) dark strokes still render/are solid in UNDER as platforms. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(If a future puzzle ever wants a dark stroke to trip a light-meter, that's now intentionally impossible — by design. Player safelight glow still registers (radius 1.5, ~0.35) but tuned not to clear the umbral alone. Pending: in-engine verify.)

## Interaction 57 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~14:00
**Development Stage:** Gameplay-depth milestone — second puzzle axis, recombination, readability (Milestone 15)
**Current Goal:** The student's open question "纵览整个项目，在玩法、设计上还可以怎么改进" (surveying the whole project, how can gameplay/design still improve)

### Student Prompt
"纵览整个项目，在玩法，设计上还可以怎么改进" — an open design-review ask, not a prescribed change list. After the plan was presented the student rejected the first light-axis design with a specific note: "用光画来开门感觉有点随意/sloppy，开门只用随便画一笔不够巧妙" (opening a door by light-painting feels arbitrary — a random stroke shouldn't open it), then chose **光轨即钥匙即梯子 (the stroke is the ladder AND the key)** as the redesign.

### Agent Response Summary
Ran a plan-mode design review: read the full codebase + all 56 prior log interactions, then a background analysis workflow (9 agents — 4 understand lenses, 4 design-critique lenses, 1 synthesis). Diagnosis the student accepted: presentation/onboarding are essentially finished (M9–M14), but the game still has **one puzzle axis** ("switch exposure → which platforms are solid → traverse"); the **light-as-substance** systems (`LightField`/`LocalLux`/`UmbralBarrier`) are built but used in exactly one trivial spot (R10's 0.5-wide umbra), and two verbs (`RiseLift`, statue-as-platform) appear once and die. The student picked three workstreams via a question prompt — **recombination (R7+R10)**, **light as a real second axis**, **readability/feel** — and explicitly **kept the auto-win finale** (no frame-11 keypress) and the slow/contemplative/no-timing constraint.

Critically, the student's "光画开门太随意" objection (the same critique they raised in I18 about the light-meter) drove a **redesign question**: I offered three non-arbitrary light-delivery designs (ladder-and-key / re-sealing-umbra-budget / coupled-side-effect); they chose **ladder-and-key**. The insight: a drawn stroke is a free place-anywhere light source, so "light reaches a meter" has no constraint — UNLESS the meter is unreachable by scribbling and the light must be delivered by a stroke that is ALSO the only way up. Implemented, all `csc`-verified step by step (no playtest — Editor open):

- **C1 jam-cause telegraph** — `ExposureManager.WouldJam` already located the offending object; surfaced it (`FirstJamObject`) and made a physical jam **flash that object amber** at its footprint (`ExposureObject.FlashJam`, an independent transient renderer so it shows even when the object is currently invisible), on top of the existing slider shake + sound.
- **A1 R7 statue + drawn step** — the first room that holds TWO verbs at once. Raised `R7_HighLedge` top 6.5→7.5: un-jumpable from the floor (apex 5.99) AND from the frozen statue (statue top 4.4 + 2.49 = 6.89), so the solve is *park the statue → freeze in UNDER → stand on it → draw one dark step → climb*. Pure `LevelData.cs`.
- **B dual-use light (the headline second axis)** — a `LocalLux` light-meter mounted on the left face of a wall too high to jump (`R6_ShaftWall` top 6.5), with no ground beside it, gating a tall door (`Door_R6L`). The rising BRIGHT stroke you draw in OVER is **solid (the ladder)** AND a `LightField` emitter **(the key)** — one stroke climbs you up and lights the meter as it passes; there is nowhere to "scribble at a door". Reuses every existing system; the only new code is a **lux readout** (the cyan iris grows/brightens with delivered light, via `PhotoSensor.LuxFill` driven in its existing `FixedUpdate`). Soft-lock-proof by construction (3-stroke budget, ~0.55 lux from a climb stroke vs 0.4 threshold, glow-alone peaks 0.35, door permanent). Also added a **playable dev-lab station 6** (warp `P`) so the mechanic can be validated in isolation before trusting the R6 numbers.
- **C2 stroke-fix juice + colour-blind check** — `TrailStroke.Fix` now flares (endpoint sparks + a glow swell-and-settle) and plays a distinct higher "set" blip (`AudioDirector.BuildFixBlip`/`PlayFixStroke`), so creating terrain is its own rewarded moment. On colour-blind: found the HUD already conveys exposure state non-chromatically (knob **position** + label brightness + "UNDER/BALANCED/OVER" text + mini-lock glyphs), so no slider rework was needed — documented rather than gratuitously changed.
- **C3 hold-to-preview** — hold 1/2/3 past ~0.18 s to ghost the objects that WOULD become solid (`ExposureManager.PreviewExposure` → `ExposureObject.SetPreviewGhost`, a soft cyan peek; shows WHERE, never whether it would jam, suppressed while the R9 blackout `Locked`s the dial). Commits on RELEASE (a quick tap still commits ~instantly; release read as an event so a release during a skipped respawn frame can't leak a stale switch). Behind a `GameManager.HoldPreviewEnabled` flag (default on; flip to false to restore instant switch-on-press if the timing feels off).

**Honest deferral: A2 (R10 lift couplet) was NOT built.** R10 is already the recombination finale (it chains drawn-bridge + burn + sensor + light-delivery umbra + dark-step + burn + guard) and has no clean free x-space for a rise/sink couplet without reworking an existing beat; authoring a deadly-gap couplet blind in the packed, graded finale is high soft-lock risk for low benefit. R7 delivers the clean two-verb recombination, and R10's existing umbra now reads as the proper callback to the R6 light-meter lesson. The couplet can be prototyped in the dev lab first if the student wants it threaded into R10.

### Development Action
Three workstreams (C1 jam telegraph, A1 R7, B dual-use light meter + lux readout + lab station, C2 stroke juice, C3 hold-to-preview); A2 deferred with reasoning. Plan-mode design pass = 9-agent analysis workflow. **No new script files** — all edits to existing files + level data, so no `.meta` authoring.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/ExposureManager.cs` (FirstJamObject + amber flash; PreviewExposure/ClearPreview + auto-clear in Apply/ForceSet), `World/ExposureObject.cs` (FlashJam; SetPreviewGhost), `World/PhotoSensor.cs` (LuxFill readout in FixedUpdate), `Player/TrailStroke.cs` (fix-flash juice), `Core/AudioDirector.cs` (BuildFixBlip/PlayFixStroke), `Core/DarkroomInput.cs` (ExposureDigitHeld/Released), `Core/GameManager.cs` (HoldPreviewEnabled + HandleExposureHold), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (lux-fill on mode==1 Sensor; dev-lab dual-use station 6), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R7 ledge raise + hint; R6 light-shaft wall + LocalLux meter + Door_R6L + CP_R6b + hint + objectives).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE_OK`, `-warnaserror`) after every step; one warnaserror catch fixed (`HoldPreviewEnabled` const → `static readonly` so the instant-switch branch isn't dead code). Batchmode validator NOT run (Editor open) — and **note**: `DarkroomValidator` is already stale (asserts `DarkPath==11` vs actual 8, refs the non-existent `R8_BarrierCeiling`, ignores trails/lifts/umbrals) and will need extending/relaxing for the new R6 sensor/door/wall and CP counts. Not committed (left for the student to review + commit with this log).

### Student Follow-up
(In-engine verify, ⌘R before ⌘P. **Dev lab (`P`) first** for the dual-use mechanic in isolation, then: ① R6 (`]`×6) PostFloor — the wall is un-jumpable; in OVER one rising bright stroke climbs you toward the wall top AND fills the cyan meter (iris fills as it nears) → Door_R6L opens; standing/jumping without drawing must NOT trip it; confirm the R6→R7 drop is clean. ② R7 (`]`×7) — ledge un-jumpable from floor and from the statue alone; statue + one drawn step climbs it. ③ jam telegraph — a refused switch flashes the offending object amber. ④ stroke-fix has its own flare + blip. ⑤ hold 1/2/3 → ghost preview; tap still feels instant — if the timing is off, set `GameManager.HoldPreviewEnabled=false`. Tunables documented in code: R6 `luxThreshold` 0.4 / meter x 91.6, R7 ledge cy. Also: remember `DevWarpEnabled=false` and fix the stale `DarkroomValidator` before grading. Decide whether to prototype the deferred R10 lift couplet in the lab.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 58 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~15:30
**Development Stage:** Tooling / regression-guard maintenance (post-Milestone 15)
**Current Goal:** Bring the stale batchmode validator (`DarkroomValidator`) back in sync with the current `LevelData` — the exact follow-up flagged at the end of I57.

### Student Prompt
Update `Assets/Scripts/Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs`: its hard-coded assertions no longer match `LevelData`. Known mismatches — asserts `DarkPath==11` (actual 8), references the deleted `R8_BarrierCeiling`, ignores the newer authored types (trails/lifts/riseLifts/bridges/burns/umbrals), and must tolerate the M15 additions (`R6_LightMeter`+`Door_R6L`+`R6_ShaftWall`+`CP_R6b`, `R7_HighLedge` at top 7.5). Either relax the literals or derive expected counts from `LevelData.Rooms`; keep it a faithful guard, then run it in batchmode with the Editor closed and confirm exit 0.

### Agent Response Summary
Read both files plus `LevelBuilder` to model exactly what `Build` instantiates as direct children of `_Level`. Chose a **hybrid**: data-table counts stay hard-coded literals (the real regression guard — a dropped/duplicated element fails them), updated to current values; the build cross-check is **derived** from `LevelData.Rooms` so it tracks the data while still catching a builder that drops/doubles a def.

Updated literals: checkpoints 13→14, sensors 2→3, doors 2→3, hints 18→20, DarkPath 11→8, BrightBarrier 5→0 (retired). Added count guards for the newer mechanics (trails 1, shadow lifts 1, rise lifts 1, light bridges 1, burn-papers 4, umbrals 1). Dropped the dead `R8_BarrierCeiling` from the chokepoint-ceiling list (the other 6 still asserted). The sensor→door resolution loop was already dynamic, so it now covers `R6_LightMeter → Door_R6L` with no edit.

Build cross-check rewrite: `expected` sums **all** def-array lengths across rooms, **plus** the structural extras `LevelBuilder` injects that are NOT one-per-def — each `RiseLift` hangs 2 shaft rails on the root (`BuildLiftDecor` default `rails:true`; the shadow `Lift` passes `rails:false`), and rooms 9+ add the `R9_Blackout` set piece. Two subtleties handled: (a) the always-on dev sandbox (`DevWarpEnabled=true`) is excluded from `actual` by a `Lab_` name filter + an x<250 threshold — needed because `Trail()` leaves its GameObject at the origin, so the dev trail can't be separated by position alone; (b) edit-mode batch runs no `Awake/OnEnable/Start` (no `[ExecuteAlways]` anywhere, confirmed), so `DarkTrail`/`ScriptedBlackout` build no children at validate-time and each is a single root child. Verified all 14 def-type counts independently via grep before running. Expected total = 106 defs + 2 rails + 1 blackout = **109**.

### Development Action
Single-file edit to `DarkroomValidator.cs` (added `DevSandboxMinX` const; rewrote the assertion block + build cross-check). Made the edit with the Editor open, then waited (background lockfile watcher) for the student to ⌘Q Unity, then ran batchmode.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` only. No data or gameplay changes; no new files/`.meta`.

### Immediate Result
Batchmode `Unity -batchmode -nographics -executeMethod Darkroom.EditorTools.Validate -logFile -` **exited 0**, with every check green and no compile errors/exceptions. Notable lines: `checkpoints == 14`, `sensors == 3`, `doors == 3`, `hints == 20`, `DarkPath boxes == 8`, `BrightBarrier == 0 (retired)`, all 6 chokepoint ceilings present, `R6_LightMeter door id resolves: Door_R6L`, and **`built level object count == 109, got 109`**. Not committed (left for the student to review + commit with this log).

### Student Follow-up
(Validator is back in sync and remains a real guard. If a future milestone adds/removes authored elements, update the corresponding literal — the build cross-check self-tracks. Reminder still standing from I57: set `DevWarpEnabled=false` before grading.)

## Interaction 59 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~14:40
**Development Stage:** Hint / UI de-noising — aggressive per-zone pass (Milestone 15)
**Current Goal:** "对 UI 和提示继续降噪…更狠一点" — turn the M14 tutorial-trim into an explicit per-zone policy so the game reads as exploration, not a tutorial

### Student Prompt
The student set a precise policy: R0–R2 may keep operational hints; **after R3, forbid blunt "Press 1 / Press 3 / Hold Shift" phrasing**; R5's Shutter pickup keeps one operational instruction; **after R6 every hint uses darkroom-narrative voice (no tutorial tone)**; each room keeps one short line, ≤70 chars. Rationale: "教程感少了，玩家会更愿意把自己当成探索者" (less tutorial feel → players see themselves as explorers).

### Agent Response Summary
Applied the policy to the per-room `HintDef`s in `LevelData.cs`, keeping only the nudges that are load-bearing to actually solve a room. **R0**: dropped the "press 1" line (redundant with the Negative pickup banner), kept move/jump + the "what is not lit is not there" concept. **R2**: merged burn + enemy-sleep into one operational line. **R3/R4**: stripped the "Press 1"/"Press 3" openers → diegetic ("The dark prints a staircase the light skipped — climb it." / "A slab of light rises — ride it up; lose the light and you fall."). **R5**: kept the single draw nudge (the Shutter debut's allowed op). **R6** (last teaching room — the policy's narrative rule is "after R6"): dropped the redundant dark-shelf line, kept the body-sensor line, trimmed the new light-meter line to ≤70 — neither uses a blunt "press X". **R7–R10**: re-voiced to darkroom-narrative — R7's statue lesson + the A1 draw nudge merged into one 69-char line; R8 → "Each bridge lives in one light — change only where the ground is real."; R10's three beats re-voiced. R9's two cryptic lines were already pure narrative — left. Net hints **20 → 16**, every line ≤70, no blunt "Press X / Hold Shift" past R2 (except the R5 Shutter pickup banner, by policy). Confirmed the HUD already complies: the Negative/Flash/Shutter **pickup banners** carry the real key controls (so per-room hints didn't have to), and the persistent **controls block** retires at x>73 (entering R6, once draw is taught) — no HUD change needed. Also updated the just-resynced `DarkroomValidator` hints literal `20 → 16` (the build cross-check sums `hints.Length`, so the object total self-corrected 109 → 105).

### Development Action
Per-room hint copy pass (de-noise to one ≤70-char line, zone-gated operational→narrative) + one validator literal. No gameplay/geometry/HUD change.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (hints only — R0/R2/R3/R4/R6/R7/R8/R10 rewritten or merged; R1/R5/R9 kept), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (hints `== 20` → `== 16`). No new files.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE_OK`). Hint count 20 → 16. Batchmode validator not re-run this round (Editor state unknown) — but only the hints literal + the self-tracking total changed, both updated. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(In-engine read-through (⌘R+⌘P / `]` warp): confirm each room shows one short line, R3+ never says "Press 1/3", and R7–R10 read as voice not instruction. Judgment calls to sanity-check: R6 kept TWO lines (last teaching room, with the new light-meter); R7's merged line must still make the statue+draw solve discoverable. If any room now feels under-guided, the cheapest fix is wording, not mechanics.)

## Interaction 60 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~16:00
**Development Stage:** Opening / prologue redesign — "THE UNPRINTED FRAME" (Milestone 16)
**Current Goal:** "最开头的引入…现在第一关让用户切 1/2 有点没有道理…场景整体引入也设计的再有意思一点，人物是怎么进入这个世界的" — motivate the first exposure switch and establish HOW the character enters the world

### Student Prompt
After choosing (via a question) **enter through the darkroom / enlarger** + **the dark holds the path (reveal-on-demand)**, the student supplied a full written spec ("The Darkroom — Opening / Prologue Redesign"): she comes to develop an old roll, the eleventh frame is always blank, she lowers the room to safelight, a path develops on the blank paper, and she steps INTO the unfinished photograph. Asked to enrich that spec with my ideas. Two forks were resolved by question: **frame numbering = renumber per the doc** (prologue unnumbered, R1–R10 = FRAME 1–10, finale = frame 11) and **restrained/affordance-safe props**.

### Agent Response Summary
Plan-mode pass: 2 Explore agents mapped the boot/opening + the narrative bookends, then 2 Plan agents (implementation design + a feasibility/ripple audit). The audit's load-bearing finding: the number 11 is an emergent agreement across `PhotoAlbum[11]`, the HUD `room+1` formula, `WinScreen`, the finale `CaptureRoom(10)`, and the validator — so **do NOT add a room**; rebuild `Rooms[0]` in place and renumber by DISPLAY only. The enrichment I added: the prologue IS the blank frame 11 she enters, and the finale **prints into that same slot** — the enter-photo cinematic is the literal inverse of `FinaleRoutine`, reusing its kit.

Implemented (all `csc`-verified, every system REUSED):
- **R0 rebuilt as the prologue** (`LevelData.Rooms[0]` "THE UNPRINTED FRAME"): entrance floor → an impassable gap to a far ground +2.9 higher (un-jumpable, apex 2.49) → the **dark bridge develops only in UNDER** (reuse `DarkTrail`) → far real ground → a blank-paper **exit door**. Non-lethal: a mis-switch drops onto `R0_CatchLedge` (a stumble, not a death). Removed the old calibration `DarkSample` + the `Negative` pickup; **Under is granted silently at boot** (`GameManager.GrantNegativeSilently`, called from `Bootstrap` and re-granted on `FullRestart`) — the safelight is always lit, so press-1 just works with no pickup banner.
- **Motivated first switch + darkroom vocab:** the slider labels read **SAFELIGHT / WORK LIGHT / ENLARGER FLASH** for the first minute and swap to UNDER/NORMAL/OVER on the Flash pickup (`HUDController.SetExposureVocab`, reset in the 3 state-paths — restart, dev-warp, unlock — so it never leaks across runs). The R0 hints are observation notes ("Frame 11 is blank.", "The print needs darkness.", "Bring back the room."), and the exposure card is suppressed in the prologue.
- **Enter-photo cinematic** (`GameManager.BeginPrologueExit`/`PrologueExitRoutine`, cloned from the finale and inverted; `LevelExit.IsPrologueDoor`): letterbox → she faces the paper → her latent silhouette develops on it → white flash + shutter + a warm light/post override → **"THE DARKROOM"** title (moved here from the first press-1) → cut to FRAME 1. The first prologue UNDER no longer pops white or drops the title (atmospheric).
- **Frame renumber (display only, 11 intact):** HUD shows the prologue unnumbered and R1–R10 as "FRAME 1–10 OF 11"; the finale prints the self-portrait into **slot 0** (the once-blank frame); `Checkpoint` skips photographing room 0; `WinScreen` strip maps positions 1–10 → slots 1–10 (the journey) and position 11 → slot 0 (the self-portrait), ending copy unchanged.
- **Restrained set-dressing** (`LevelBuilder.BuildPrologueProps`, one container child so the object-count check stays exact): a dim red safelight (prominent in UNDER, washed by the work light in NORMAL — the per-exposure lighting carries the "safelight rises" read for free) + developing trays; the prologue exit toned from a blinding doorway to a **calm blank sheet**. The rich illustrated backdrop carries the rest. Boot opens with a low room tone.
- **Validator resynced:** pickups 3→2, exits 1→2, hints 16→17, trails 1→2, DarkPath 8→7, + the prologue-props container in the object-count.

**Honestly scoped down (deferred polish, the core works without them):** a `PrologueDirector` that actively animates the safelight on each switch, a `StuckHintEscalator` (3 escalating gap hints), and a true eyeless `SilhouetteArt.GirlFaceless` (the cinematic tints `PlayerIdle` dark instead). None are load-bearing.

### Development Action
Opening/prologue redesign: R0 rebuilt + motivated first switch + darkroom-vocab labels + enter-photo cinematic + display-only frame renumber + restrained darkroom dressing. No new room; the hard-coded 11 untouched. No new script files (so no `.meta` authoring).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (Rooms[0]), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (prologue exit flag + paper toning + `BuildPrologueProps`), `Core/GameManager.cs` (`GrantNegativeSilently`, `BeginPrologueExit`/`PrologueExitRoutine`, finale `CaptureRoom(10)`→`(0)`, FullRestart re-grant), `Core/Bootstrap.cs` (silent grant), `UI/HUDController.cs` (vocab labels + `SetExposureVocab` + `DropTitle`/`FullFlash` + renumber formula + frame card + ShowCard gate + title move + resets + boot tone), `World/LevelExit.cs` (`IsPrologueDoor`), `World/Checkpoint.cs` (skip room 0), `UI/WinScreen.cs` (strip remap), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (count literals + props container).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE_OK`, `-warnaserror`) at every step. Batchmode validator NOT run (Editor open) — literals updated + object-count delta verified by hand (+4 expected, +4 actual), to be confirmed when the Editor closes. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(In-engine, ⌘R before ⌘P, from a fresh boot: ① quiet darkroom fade-up → "one roll. eleven frames." → the slider reads **SAFELIGHT/WORK LIGHT/ENLARGER FLASH**; ② walk right, hit the impassable gap → "The print needs darkness" → press 1: the room darkens and the dark bridge develops; walk UP it (confirm the ~49° slope walks cleanly — the one blind-tuned bit) to the far ground; ③ press 2 reads as raising the work light; ④ step into the blank paper → silhouette develops + white flash + **THE DARKROOM** → FRAME 1 OF 11. Then: after the **Flash** pickup (R2) the labels swap to UNDER/NORMAL/OVER; a mis-switch on the bridge is a stumble onto the catch ledge, not a death; the **win screen** shows the 10 journey frames + the self-portrait as frame 11. Tunables: R0 far-ground cy / bridge points (slope), catch-ledge depth. Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed; remember `DevWarpEnabled=false` before grading. Optional next polish: the deferred safelight animator / stuck-hint escalator / eyeless paper silhouette.)

## Interaction 61 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~17:00
**Development Stage:** Prologue playtest fixes (Milestone 16)
**Current Goal:** Student screenshot of the in-engine prologue: the dark bridge "走不上去" (can't be walked up), the red safelight "太丑" (a flat ugly disc), and "做的更符合我的文档一点" (more faithful to the doc)

### Student Prompt
A screenshot of the running prologue ("THE UNPRINTED FRAME"): the slider correctly reads SAFELIGHT/WORK LIGHT/ENLARGER FLASH and the first note shows — but the **dark bridge slope can't be climbed**, and the **safelight is a flat red disc**. Asked to use an AI-generated lamp from the existing assets (or supply a prompt for a new one), and fix the slope.

### Agent Response Summary
**Slope (the real bug):** the bridge was ~49° — too steep for the slope-walk to climb (the box wedges against the near-vertical edge). R1's working trail is ~19° max, so I re-authored R0 as a **gentle ~15–17° bow** to a lower far ground: gap widened to 5u and the far ground lowered from +2.9 (top 3.4) to +1.3 (top 1.8) — still un-jumpable (a jump reaches ~1.4 at a 5u gap, the top is 1.8) but now comfortably walkable. The non-lethal catch ledge was lowered to top −1.0 so you also can't jump from it straight onto the far ground (no skip), while still surviving a mis-switch + climbing back.
**Safelight (the ugly lamp):** replaced the flat `PixelArt.Disc` with the student's **existing AI cutout `art/mid_safelight.png`** (a darkroom safelight fixture), loaded via a new public `PixelArt.Art(file, ppu)` one-off loader, lifted toward a lit tone and scaled to ~1.7u, plus a real red `Light2D` (parented to the unscaled container so the fixture's scale doesn't shrink the light). It falls back to the old soft glow if the PNG is ever absent. The enlarger was NOT added as a foreground prop (it lives only in `_props_removed/` and would re-trip the I37 affordance rule); `bd_enlarger_row.png` already depicts enlargers in the backdrop. The blank-paper door was enlarged toward the doc's "giant sheet".

### Development Action
Re-authored the R0 bridge/far-ground/catch for a walkable gentle slope; swapped the safelight to the AI fixture cutout; added `PixelArt.Art`. Object counts unchanged (validator literals still valid).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R0 geometry + bigger paper-door), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`BuildPrologueProps` safelight cutout), `Core/PixelArt.cs` (`Art` loader).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE_OK`). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Re-test: ① the dark bridge should now WALK up smoothly (hold right in UNDER) — if it ever still catches, lower `R0_FarGround` cy a touch or add an intermediate bridge point; ② the safelight should read as a hanging red fixture, not a flat disc — tune its tint `(1.0,0.66,0.55)` / scale `1.7` / `Art` ppu, or the red light intensity, if it's too dim/bright. If `mid_safelight.png` still looks off, here's a prompt for a dedicated one to generate and drop into `StreamingAssets/art/` as `mid_safelight.png` (the loader picks it up automatically): *"A single vintage darkroom safelight lamp, red dome lantern with a dark metal housing and a short hanging cord, glowing deep safelight red, isolated on a flat #787878 mid-gray background, soft even studio lighting, side view, no other objects, no text, photographic, high detail."* — then run `python art-pipeline/process_aigen.py` to chroma-key it.)

## Interaction 62 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~17:40
**Development Stage:** Prologue — the three-layer "darkroom develops into the photo" treatment (Milestone 16)
**Current Goal:** "还是按照这个来做" — implement the student's full opening script + the three-layer scene-introduction faithfully

### Student Prompt
Re-pasted the complete recommended opening script (black + drip/fan/distant-shutter + "one roll. eleven frames."; HUD only move/jump; "Frame 11 is blank."; press 1 → safelight + dark bridge + "1 — safelight"; "Bring back the room." → press 2 + "2 — work light"; enter the paper → faceless silhouette + flash + THE DARKROOM → FRAME 1 OF 11) **and** the three-layer transformation (Layer 1 real darkroom; Layer 2 after press 1 = photo lines overlay reality; Layer 3 inside the photo). "Do it according to this."

### Agent Response Summary
Implemented the script + a tasteful version of the three layers (all REUSED systems; one new prologue-only component):
- **Layer 1 (real darkroom):** a new `LevelBuilder.BuildDryingRoll` hangs the roll on a wire — **eleven clipped frames, ten dim/developed and the eleventh a brighter blank sheet** — so "Frame 11 is blank" is shown, not just told (the hint now triggers under that blank frame). Plus the AI safelight fixture + developing trays + the existing illustrated darkroom backdrop.
- **Layer 2 (press 1 transforms the room):** a new `World/PrologueDirector.cs` listens to `ExposureManager.OnExposureChanged` and, in the safelight (UNDER), **fades in negative-scratch lines across the walls** (6 thin additive cyan-white streaks) and **lifts the red safelight glow**; the work light (NORMAL) fades them back. The hanging-film→dark-path and blank-paper→door-seam beats are the existing `DarkTrail` bridge + paper-door. The director also surfaces the **"1 — safelight" / "2 — work light"** key hints once each (new `HUDController.ShowKeyHint`).
- **Layer 3 (enter the photo):** the existing enter-photo cinematic (white flash → THE DARKROOM → FRAME 1) carries it.
- **Script polish:** the controls HUD now shows **only A/D move · SPACE jump** until the enlarger flash (R2) is owned (the slider label + the "1 — safelight" hint teach the rest); the boot black holds longer with a **distant shutter** click; "Frame 11 is blank." trimmed to the doc's exact line.

### Development Action
Three-layer prologue treatment: drying-roll (Layer 1), `PrologueDirector` scratch-lines + safelight + key-hints (Layer 2), move/jump-only HUD + boot shutter + text. One new component (`PrologueDirector`, +hand-made `.meta`).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New `World/PrologueDirector.cs` (+meta). Edited `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`BuildPrologueProps` + `BuildDryingRoll` + `BuildScratch`, all under the one props container), `Core/PixelArt.cs` (already had `Art`), `UI/HUDController.cs` (`ShowKeyHint`, controls gated to move/jump pre-Flash, boot shutter), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R0 hint text/positions).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE_OK`). Object counts unchanged (all new props live under the single `PrologueProps` container; validator literals still valid — pickups 2 / exits 2 / trails 2 / hints 17 verified). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Re-test the full open: ① black + distant shutter + "one roll. eleven frames."; ② HUD shows only move/jump; under the drying line the eleventh frame is blank → "Frame 11 is blank."; ③ press 1 → the room darkens, **scratch lines bleed across the walls**, the safelight glows, "1 — safelight", the dark bridge develops; ④ cross → "Bring back the room" → press 2 → scratches fade, "2 — work light"; ⑤ the paper → silhouette + flash + THE DARKROOM → FRAME 1 OF 11. Tunables: scratch count/positions/`ScratchMax` (`PrologueDirector`), drying-roll `x0/step`, safelight `SafelightDim/Lit`. If the scratches read too strong/weak, adjust `ScratchMax` (0.5). Batchmode validator when the Editor closes; `DevWarpEnabled=false` before grading.)

## Interaction 63 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~18:15
**Development Stage:** Prologue — rebuild the opening to the student's full script, faithfully (Milestone 17)
**Current Goal:** "还是按照这个来做" — the previous pass didn't fully match the script; redo it to the complete beat sheet + the three-layer scene-introduction (Layer 3 bounded to the transition/handoff, confirmed with the student)

### Student Prompt
Re-pasted the complete recommended opening, holding the previous attempt to it: black + **water drip / darkroom fan / distant shutter** under a single faint **"one roll. eleven frames."**; HUD only `A / D — move` / `SPACE — jump`; walk to the **workbench**, photos on the wall, the 11th clip a blank sheet → "Frame 11 is blank."; "The print needs darkness." → press `1` → safelight + dark bridge **on the paper** → "1 — safelight"; "Bring back the room." → press `2` → "2 — work light"; push the door → **not a room but a giant photo paper**, her **blank-faced** silhouette develops, shutter, white flash, **THE DARKROOM** → **FRAME 1 OF 11 — THE LONG EXPOSURE**. Plus the three layers (1 real darkroom; 2 photo-lines overlay under safelight; 3 fully inside the photo).

### Agent Response Summary
Implemented the whole script in one pass, reusing every existing system and adding no `LevelData` defs (validator literals untouched):
- **Black-screen bed (Audio):** new procedural **water drip** (`BuildDrip`/`PlayDrip`) and **ventilation fan loop** (`BuildFanLoop`/`SetFan`) in `AudioDirector`; `BootIn` now layers fan-in → drip → distant shutter → drip, then ducks the fan as the room develops up.
- **Faint single line:** `TitleCard` dropped the "develop the world…" tagline; only **"one roll. eleven frames."** now, glowing up faint on black and dissolving as the world fades in.
- **Minimized prologue HUD:** controls show **exactly** `A / D — move` / `SPACE — jump` (no pause/retry/exposure) until she steps into Frame 1 (`_prologueControls` gate, reset on replay).
- **Full frame card:** `FrameCardRoutine` now reads **"FRAME N OF 11 — <title>"** (was "— FRAME N —").
- **Layer 1 props:** new `PrologueBench` (workbench under the trays) + `PrologueEnlarger` (column / cantilevered lamphouse / lens), dark silhouettes under the single `PrologueProps` container.
- **Layer 2 overlay:** `PrologueDirector` gained an `Overlays` list (`OverlayMax`) fading with the same safelight `_t`; `LevelBuilder` registers **platform photo-edge lines** (floor + far-ground tops) and **door seams/cracks** on the blank-paper door — they surface under the safelight, recede in work light, alongside the negative scratches.
- **Blank face + giant paper (Layer 3 handoff):** new `SilhouetteArt.PlayerBlank` (the idle girl with **no eye** — the unprinted self); `GameManager.PrologueExitRoutine` now **recedes the darkroom behind a scrim and reveals a giant sheet of photo paper**, develops her blank-faced silhouette on it, shutter + white flash + warm sweep + **THE DARKROOM**, then dissolves the paper/scrim onto Frame 1 ("the photo space develops in").

### Development Action
Faithful opening rebuild across six files; one new sprite (`PlayerBlank`), two new synth clips (drip/fan), one new director list (`Overlays`), and a runtime giant-paper set-piece. No new `.cs` files (no metas needed); no `LevelData` def changes.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (drip + fan synth/API/Awake/Update), `Core/SilhouetteArt.cs` (`Girl` eye flag + `PlayerBlank`), `UI/HUDController.cs` (`BootIn`, `TitleCard`, `RebuildControls` + `_prologueControls` gate, `FrameCardRoutine`, frame-card width), `World/PrologueDirector.cs` (`Overlays`/`OverlayMax`), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`PrologueBench`/`PrologueEnlarger`/`BuildOverlayLine`/`PropRect` under `PrologueProps`), `Core/GameManager.cs` (`PrologueExitRoutine` giant-paper reveal + `MakeRevealSprite`/`SetA`).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Object counts unchanged — all new build-time props live under the single `PrologueProps` container; the giant paper / scrim / silhouette are runtime cinematic objects (not built by `LevelBuilder.Build`); no `LevelData` defs added, so the validator literals (rooms 11 / hints 17 / trails 2 / exits 2 …) and the object-count check stay valid. Batchmode validator deferred (Editor was open / lockfile present). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Force a recompile — ⌘R / Assets→Refresh — **before** ⌘P, else Unity runs the stale assembly. Then re-test the full open: ① black + fan + two drips + distant shutter, faint "one roll. eleven frames."; ② room lights up, HUD shows ONLY move/jump; the workbench + enlarger frame the start, the drying roll's 11th frame is blank → "Frame 11 is blank."; ③ "The print needs darkness." → press 1 → safelight, scratches + **platform photo-edges + door cracks** bleed in, the dark bridge develops, "1 — safelight"; ④ cross → "Bring back the room." → press 2 → overlay recedes, "2 — work light"; ⑤ the door → **giant photo paper** + **blank-faced** silhouette + flash + THE DARKROOM → **FRAME 1 OF 11 — THE LONG EXPOSURE**. Tunables: drip/fan levels (`BootIn` `SetFan`, `PlayDrip` spacing), faint-text alpha (`TitleCard` 0.55), `OverlayMax` (0.7), bench/enlarger coords (`PrologueBench`/`PrologueEnlarger`), giant-paper scale/timings (`PrologueExitRoutine`). Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed; `DevWarpEnabled=false` before grading.)

## Interaction 64 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~19:10
**Development Stage:** Prologue — relocate + lengthen into an isolated "long corridor" intro (Milestone 17.1)
**Current Goal:** Screenshot feedback: the scratches look unnatural; want a long A/D walk BEFORE the photos; the bridge→door path is too short (can almost skip to the door); and the door shouldn't reveal Frame 1 — "传送到一个更远的地方，这样开头才像引入"

### Student Prompt
On the prologue screenshot: ① the scratches (blue diagonal sticks) feel unnatural; ② want to first walk a long stretch on the platform, THEN see the hanging photos; ③ after the photos you can basically jump straight to the door — make the path longer and more poetic; ④ don't let the path-behind (Frame 1) be visible at the door — teleport to a much farther place so the opening reads as an introduction. (Confirmed: make scratches more natural, not removed; make it a genuinely long isolated corridor.)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed the "see the path behind" as structural — Room 0 (x −7.5…5.5) sat *immediately adjacent* to Frame 1 (x 5.5), and `CameraFollow.MinX=-2` + a ~19u view meant the door already showed Frame 1; the cinematic only teleported ~1.3u. Fix = make the prologue an isolated far-left pocket and teleport across a wide empty gap:
- **Relocated + lengthened Room 0** to x ≈ −48…−5 (a ~2-screen corridor): long entrance walk (`R0_FloorA` x −47.5…−23) → drying roll overhead (blank 11th at −25) → a WIDE 11u gap → a long, gently arcing `R0_DarkBridge` (5 points) → far ground + paper-door at −6. Same def counts (4 boxes / 1 trail / 1 checkpoint / 1 exit / 3 hints) → validator literals & object-count untouched. `RoomStarts[0]` → −49; `Bootstrap.SpawnPos` → (−46, 1.5); `CP_R0` → (−46, 1.2).
- **Camera fencing:** new `Bootstrap.PrologueCamMinX/MaxX` (−40 / −4.5); fenced at boot (`SetupCamera`) and on `FullRestart` so the pocket frames correctly and Frame 1 is never on screen at the door. `PrologueExitRoutine` now restores real-level bounds, **SNAPs** the camera across the gap while the scrim hides the jump, and re-centers the giant paper so it dissolves INTO Frame 1.
- **Tint decoupled:** `CameraFollow.TintMinX/TintMaxX` (−2 / 170) so lowering the camera `MinX` for the prologue can't warm Frames 1-10 (or warm the relocated prologue).
- **Scratches made natural:** non-additive `SpriteMat` instead of additive glow, desaturated grey-blue, thinner (0.014), fewer (6 → 4), varied length/angle scattered down the corridor; `ScratchMax` 0.5 → 0.28, overlay edges softened to off-white, `OverlayMax` 0.7 → 0.5.
- **Backdrop coverage:** the pocket sits left of the lamp/scene loops' start, so added explicit prologue lamps (4, key-light) + deep scenes (3) AFTER the loops — so the relocated prologue isn't a dark void and Frames 1-10 RNG placement doesn't shift. Props (safelight/roll/bench/enlarger/trays/overlays) migrated to the new coords.

### Development Action
Prologue relocation + lengthening + camera fencing + scratch/overlay softening + backdrop coverage. No new files; no `LevelData` def-count changes.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/CameraFollow.cs` (tint anchors), `Core/Bootstrap.cs` (SpawnPos + prologue cam consts + fence at boot), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R0 relocated/lengthened + `RoomStarts[0]`), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (prop coords + softer/fewer scratches + respaced roll), `World/PrologueDirector.cs` (`ScratchMax`/`OverlayMax`), `Core/GameManager.cs` (snap+restore bounds on door teleport; re-fence on `FullRestart`; re-center reveal), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (explicit prologue lamps + scenes).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Validator literals & object-count unchanged (R0 def counts identical — only repositioned; new backdrop lamps/scenes live under `_Backdrop`, not `_Level`). Batchmode validator deferred (Editor open). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Re-test: she starts small at the left wall under the safelight → walks a long quiet corridor (~2 screens) → reaches the workbench/enlarger with the drying roll overhead, 11th frame blank → wide dark gap, press 1 → a long arc of light develops → cross → "Bring back the room" → press 2 → door → giant paper + blank-faced silhouette + flash + THE DARKROOM → FRAME 1, with the prologue nowhere in sight. Tunables: corridor length (`R0_FloorA` width + `SpawnPos`), gap width / bridge arc points (`R0_DarkBridge`), camera framing (`PrologueCamMinX/MaxX`), scratch count/`ScratchMax`, prologue lamp/scene x in `BackdropBuilder`. If the long walk feels too long, shrink `R0_FloorA` and move `SpawnPos`/`CP_R0`/`PrologueCamMinX` right together. Batchmode validator once the Editor is closed.)

**Development Stage:** Prologue entrance — fix the "patchwork" backdrop (Milestone 17.2)
**Current Goal:** Screenshot: the entrance "拼接的怪怪的" (looks weirdly stitched)

### Student Prompt
On the relocated prologue: the entrance composition looks pieced-together / stitched.

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed: the 3 explicit illustrated "deep scene" tiles I'd added for the relocated prologue (Interaction 64) were the culprit — wide (~18–21u) hero backdrops at fixed, too-close x (−44/−30/−16) and α0.92, so in the sparse prologue they read as pasted, seam-y panels (a desk illustration + a generic photo-wall), the photo-wall also fighting the procedural 11-frame drying roll. Removed them entirely: the prologue now stays a clean SILHOUETTE darkroom — procedural props (workbench / enlarger / drying roll / trays / safelight) + its own warm lamps over the dark background (Limbo-style), no illustrated tiles to seam. Kept the explicit prologue lamps (key light). The main-loop scenes (x ≥ −8) never reach the prologue, so Frames 1-10 are unaffected.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` — removed the explicit prologue `Layer_Scenes` tiles (kept the prologue lamps).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). No data/validator impact. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The entrance should now read as one coherent dark darkroom: lamp-lit girl, the enlarger + workbench + drying roll as silhouettes, no stitched panels. If it now feels too empty/flat behind the props, say so — I can add a SINGLE dim, heavily-feathered back-wall (one tile, no inter-tile seam) for depth, or enrich the procedural workbench silhouette.)

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~20:05
**Development Stage:** Prologue — farther/higher exit ledge + code-drawn red safelight (Milestone 17.3)
**Current Goal:** Three asks: (1) make the post-tutorial platform farther, (2) draw the red safelight in code like the existing lamps, (3) raise the teleport door so it feels impossible to jump up to

### Student Prompt
① The platform after the teaching section should be farther; ② the red indicator light should use the code-drawn-lamp approach (reference the existing code lamps); ③ make the final teleport door higher so the user feels they can't possibly jump up to it.

### Agent Response Summary
- **Farther + higher exit (① + ③):** widened the prologue gap 11u → **14u** and raised the far ground from top 1.4 (+0.9) to **top 2.8 (+2.3)** — clearly un-jumpable from the entrance. The `R0_DarkBridge` is now a longer 6-point arc that CLIMBS from the entrance (0.5) up to the high ledge (2.8). The paper-door now perches high on that ledge (`ExitDef` y 3.0 → **4.4**, spanning y2.8…6.0), towering as the exit. Moved the "Bring back the room" hint and the far-edge / door-seam overlays up to match. Same R0 def counts → validator untouched.
- **Code-drawn red safelight (②):** replaced the `art/mid_safelight.png` AI cutout (+ disc fallback) with a procedural `BuildSafelight` drawn in the SAME idiom as `BackdropBuilder.Lamp` — cord + dark `ConeShade` housing + HDR red `Disc` bulb + red `SoftGlow` halo + a short red `LightBeam`, plus the real red `Light2D`. The glow halo is handed to `PrologueDirector.Safelight`, so it rises under the safelight (UNDER) and washes out under the work light (NORMAL). New `BuildSafelight` + `SafelightPart` helpers.
- Cinematic: re-center the giant-paper reveal on BOTH axes now (the higher door raised the cinematic camera Y).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R0 far ground higher + wider gap + climbing bridge + raised door/hint), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (procedural red `BuildSafelight`/`SafelightPart`; far-edge/door-seam overlay coords), `Core/GameManager.cs` (reveal re-center XY).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). R0 def counts unchanged (boxes 4 / trail 1 / checkpoint 1 / exit 1 / hints 3) → validator literals & object-count valid. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Re-test: press 1 at the wide gap → a long arc of light CLIMBS to a high ledge where the door towers, clearly too far+high to jump → cross, "Bring back the room", press 2 → into the door. The safelight is now a code-drawn red lamp (bulb + halo + short beam) that brightens in safelight, dims in work light. Tunables: gap width / ledge height (`R0_FarGround` cy + `R0_DarkBridge` points), door height (`ExitDef` cy), safelight colours/scale (`BuildSafelight`), `SafelightDim/Lit` (`PrologueDirector`). Note: the climb-back from a bridge mis-switch is still the +1.5 step at x −23 (unchanged from before). Batchmode validator once the Editor is closed.)

**Time:** 2026-06-18 ~20:40
**Development Stage:** Prologue — multi-safelight + bigger swing, and de-duplicate the bridge vs Frame 1 (Milestone 17.4)
**Current Goal:** (1) the single safelight scrolls off as she walks + its change is too subtle; (2) the prologue and Frame 1 both being "press-1 → trail across a gap" feels repetitive — asked how to improve

### Student Prompt
① The red safelight disappears as the user walks forward, and its on/off change isn't obvious. ② The opening tutorial and Frame 1 both use underexposed-to-bridge-a-gap — repetitive; how to improve? (Chose: prologue → climb dark STEPS.)

### Agent Response Summary
- **Safelight (always visible + obvious):** the single fixture became **three** code-drawn red safelights down the corridor (x −44 / −28 / −13) so one is always on screen as she walks. The `PrologueDirector` now drives a LIST of them and swings BOTH the glow halo (α 0.12 → 1.0, near-off → full) AND the real red `Light2D` intensity (0.12 → 0.6) with the mode — so pressing 1 visibly lights the red pools, pressing 2 washes them out. (`BuildSafelight` parameterized by x; registers glow + Light2D with the director; new director fields `Safelights`/`SafeLights2D` + `SafeIntensityDim/Lit`.)
- **De-duplicate vs Frame 1 (chosen: prologue climbs steps):** replaced R0's `DarkTrail` light-bridge with **three UNDER-only `DarkPath` step-ledges** (R0_Step1/2/3) climbing the wide gap up to the high door — a CLIMB (hops up developing footing), distinct from Frame 1's horizontal light-trail crossing, and a better fit for the prologue's "the missing footing develops" narrative. Same UNDER-only / mis-switch-drops-to-catch-ledge behaviour. Frame 1 keeps its `R1_SeeTrail` (the "first sighting of a light-trail").

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`World/PrologueDirector.cs` (`Safelights`/`SafeLights2D` lists + intensity swing), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`BuildSafelight(x)` ×3, registers glow+light), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R0: bridge trail → 3 DarkPath step-ledges), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (literals: trails 2→1, DarkPath 7→10).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Object-count stays balanced: R0 −1 trail child +3 DarkPath children = +2 on both expected & actual; updated the two affected validator literals (trails→1, darkPaths→10). Editor open → batchmode validator deferred. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Re-test: red safelights stay in view the whole walk and clearly light up on 1 / wash out on 2; at the gap, press 1 → dark step-ledges DEVELOP and you HOP up them to the high door (no longer a "bridge"); Frame 1 is still the horizontal light-trail. Tunables: step count/spacing/height (`R0_Step1..3` in LevelData), safelight count/positions (`BuildSafelight` calls), swing (`SafelightDim/Lit`, `SafeIntensityDim/Lit`). If the hops feel too fiddly, widen the steps or reduce the rise. Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed to confirm trails==1 / DarkPath==10.)

### Student Prompt
Screenshot: the first red safelight overlaps a (white) work-lamp — adjust.

### Agent Response Summary
The safelights (−44/−28/−13) shared x with a warm work-lamp (work-lamps hang at −44/−33/−22/−9, so the first pair stacked exactly). Moved the three safelights into the GAPS between the work-lamps: **−38.5 / −27.5 / −15.5** — each now ≥5u from any work-lamp, so no red lamp stacks on a white one, while still keeping one in view across the walk.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelBuilder.cs` — repositioned the 3 `BuildSafelight` calls (no count/validator impact).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`). Not committed.

**Time:** 2026-06-19 ~17:58
**Development Stage:** Comprehensive sound-design pass + checkpoint fix (Milestone 18 — "sound as scene")
**Current Goal:** Make the audio more engaging and more scene-appropriate; the checkpoint SFX sounded "小怪" (weird). Student chose the broad scope (everything incl. ambience/UI) and an "airy camera confirm" direction for the checkpoint.

### Student Prompt
全面看一下这个 sound design，想要更引人入胜、更多符合场景的音效；现在存档点的音效有点小怪。 (Chose: scope = everything incl. ambience/UI; checkpoint = airy camera confirm.)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed the whole sonic palette first (3 Explore agents + a Plan-agent architecture review): all audio is procedurally synthesized in `AudioDirector` (no asset files), and the signature *world mechanics were silent* — burning paper, the light/shadow lifts, the umbral barrier, fix-platforms, and the light-sensitive guard made no sound. The checkpoint was two bare staggered sine plinks (600/900 Hz) with an onset click.
- **Checkpoint redesign (the fix):** rebuilt `BuildCheckpoint` as an "airy camera confirm" — KEEPS the 600 + 900 Hz seed notes (they grow into the finale chord 600/900/1200), but adds a soft 12 ms attack (kills the click), a gentler ~0.5 s decay so the two notes breathe together, a detuned 1.006× shimmer, and a breathy lowpassed-noise puff. Softer (0.32).
- **New scene SFX (procedural):** burn **sizzle bed** that swells with char level + a **burn-through whoosh**; a shared **lift-motion bed** (bright/high pitch rising, dark/low sinking) gated on the slab actually moving; umbral **recoil/reseal** one-shots; a warm fix-platform **print**; a menacing guard **wake** swell + brittle **freeze** crackle.
- **Ambience:** a faint per-room **mood drone** (49/49.5/98 Hz, off the hum's 55 Hz stack, ducked) keyed off the HUD room poll + sparse **darkroom drips** during calm exploration (never the prologue, the blackout, the finale, or a respawn).
- **UI/feedback:** a delicate **frame-card chime**; the exposure click faintly **pitched per target state** (own AudioSource so it never bleeds); **death-cause** variation (`PlayDeath(DeathCause)` — sharper for the guard, a soft sigh for R); a first-time-only **hint pop**; a guarded **hold-preview tone**; and a rising **sensor-charge tone** that resolves into the door.
- **Architecture safety (from the Plan-agent review):** chose edge-driven On/Off for the lift bed (FixedUpdate requesters) and a same-frame max-request for the burn bed (Update requesters) to avoid the no-physics-step gutter; muted the guard's first (spawn) state application via `_stateInitialized` and gated wake/freeze by player proximity (a global OVER switch no longer makes every enemy in the level sound); suppressed umbral/freeze SFX during respawn; mood+charge join the duck, preview does not.

`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (bulk: redesigned `BuildCheckpoint`; 5 new beds `_burn`/`_lift`/`_mood`/`_preview`/`_charge` + `_expSfx`; ~14 new `Build*` synth; new `Play*`/`LiftOn/Off`/`RequestBurn`/`SetRoomMood`/`Start/StopPreviewTone`/`SetSensorChargeTone`; `PlayDeath(DeathCause)`; pitched exposure click; ambient-drip + bed ramps in `Update`), `World/BurnPaper.cs` (request sizzle + burn-through), `World/RiseLift.cs` & `World/ShadowLift.cs` (lift bed on the moving edge), `World/UmbralBarrier.cs` (open/seal, respawn-guarded), `World/FixPlatform.cs` (print), `World/LightSensitiveEnemy.cs` (wake/freeze + `_stateInitialized` + proximity gate), `World/PhotoSensor.cs` (charge tone, LocalLux only), `UI/HUDController.cs` (`SetRoomMood` on room poll, frame-card chime, first-time hint pop), `Core/GameManager.cs` (death cause threaded through, preview tone in the hold handler).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). No new files (edits only → no new metas). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Listen: checkpoint = a soft airy "saved" (no plink); R2 = hold OVER → sizzle then a burn-through whoosh, the guard wakes; press 2 → it freezes (crackle); R4 rise-lift / R9 shadow-lift = a motion hum only while riding-and-moving (bright up / dark down), silent on respawn; R6 = a rising charge tone that resolves into the door; R10 = umbral open/reseal + fix-platform print; new frames = a card chime + a subliminal per-room mood; exposure switch faintly darker→Under / brighter→Over; deaths differ by cause, R stays quiet; hold 1/2/3 = a soft preview tone only when it would change state; the R9 blackout + finale stay silent. Tunables: per-room mood table (`AudioDirector.SetRoomMood`), bed volume ceilings (mood ≤0.06 / charge ≤0.05 / preview ≤0.04 / lift 0.09 / burn 0.10), drip cadence (`ScheduleNextDrip`, 18–40 s). If the preview tone or hint pop annoy, they're the easiest to dial down or cut. Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed.)

## Interaction 70 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-19 ~18:10
**Development Stage:** Background music — a loaded melody over the evolving bed (Milestone 18.1)
**Current Goal:** Add background music. Student chose: produce it by LOADING a track file (not procedural synth), with the character "melody over the evolving bed".

### Student Prompt
"I want to add a background music." (Chose: approach = load a music track file; character = melody over the evolving ambient bed.)

### Agent Response Summary
The evolving bed already exists (per-room mood drone, exposure hum/hiss, R9 wind, R10 pedal), so the new piece is the loaded *melody* on top of it. Mirrored the project's existing external-asset path — `PixelArt.LoadExternal` reads art from `StreamingAssets/` via raw file I/O and degrades silently when absent — but audio needs real decoding, so the music loads through `UnityWebRequestMultimedia.GetAudioClip` (ogg/wav/mp3) rather than raw PCM (the naive `AudioClip.Create`+`SetData` on encoded bytes would just be noise).
- **Runtime music loader (`AudioDirector.LoadMusic`, coroutine from `Start`):** scans `StreamingAssets/music/` (sorted), picks the first `.ogg`/`.wav`/`.mp3`, infers `AudioType`, builds a proper `file://` URI via `new System.Uri(path).AbsoluteUri` (encodes the space in "The Darkroom"), and loops the clip on a new `_music` source. Missing folder/file → no music, no error (graceful degrade, like the art).
- **Mix ("melody over evolving bed"):** `MusicVolume` default 0.20, ramped in `Update`. It holds OUT of the prologue (Frame 0) so the intimate drip/fan open breathes, fades in at Frame 1, multiplies by the same `_duck` so it pulls back for the R9 blackout, and falls to silence during the finale cinematic + win screen so those built-on-silence beats survive.
- **Authoring:** created `Assets/StreamingAssets/music/` with a `README.txt` telling the student to drop one track there (ogg recommended) and how the mix/tunables work. No Unity import needed — it's raw streaming from disk.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (`using UnityEngine.Networking`; `_music` source + `MusicVolume`; `LoadMusic` coroutine started from `Start`; music volume ramp in `Update` gated by prologue/duck/cinematic/win), new `Assets/StreamingAssets/music/README.txt`.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`) — note this now also needs `UnityEngine.UnityWebRequestModule.dll` + `UnityEngine.UnityWebRequestAudioModule.dll` on the csc refs (Unity references them automatically in-engine). No new scripts (no new metas). Not committed. No music file present yet → game runs silent-of-music until the student adds one.

### Student Follow-up
(Drop a track into `Assets/StreamingAssets/music/` — e.g. `theme.ogg` — then just ⌘P (no ⌘R needed; it's read straight from disk, not a Unity asset import). It loops over the ambience from Frame 1 on, ducks through the R9 blackout, and goes quiet for the finale + win. Tunables in `AudioDirector`: `MusicVolume` (0.20 — lower it if it fights the hum/hiss/mood, raise to bring the melody forward); the prologue-silence gate is `mroom < 1`; remove the `IsCinematic || HasWon` line if you want music to carry into the finale/win. .ogg is the most reliable format; .mp3 works on standalone but is less certain.)

## Interaction 71 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-22
**Development Stage:** Design uplift — activate the stranded mechanics (Milestone 19)
**Current Goal:** "Thinking about game design, how to improve." A full design pass: diagnose, then improve WITHIN the 11-frame spine. Student chose all four themes (rescue stranded mechanics · game-feel · pacing/teaching · narrative binding) at full-milestone scope.

### Student Prompt
Thinking about game design, how to improve. (Chose: emphasis = all four themes; scope = full milestone.)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed first (3 Explore agents over level/feel/narrative + a 5-lens → adversarial-critique → synthesis workflow: 29 proposals, 23 survivors). Core finding: the game is **mechanically rich but pedagogically lopsided** — three fully-built systems sit stranded (`FixPlatform` only in the dev sandbox, the LocalLux meter only in R6, `UmbralBarrier` only in the R10 finale), R0/R1/R3 redundantly teach the same "dark holds your footing" lesson, and movement has zero-acceleration stiffness. Through-line: **activate what's already built, inside the 11 frames that already exist.** Guiding metaphor: **R2 burns to commit · R3 prints to commit · R5 draws to commit.**

**Phase 1 — game-feel quick wins (no geometry; MoveSpeed/JumpForce/gravity byte-stable):**
- Ground accel/decel ramp (`PlayerController`, GroundAccel 110 / GroundDecel 130) — kills the snap; slope-tangent + zero-target-on-no-input preserved so slope-parking never creeps; air control left near-instant.
- Variable jump (tap=hop, hold=full): release Space while rising → `v.y *= 0.5` once; `_jumpCut` reset on ground + in `Teleport`; max jump unchanged so every gap still clears.
- Fall-speed-scaled landing squash (`PlayerAnimator`, Lerp 0.06→0.28 on the same /15 fall reference the audio uses) — visual-only child scale.
- Eased switch-flash + shared palette (`HUDController`): the one-frame snap is now a ~0.10s SmoothStep ease from a 0.55 peak tinted toward the destination state (cool Under / warm Over) — audio pitch, screen tint and flash now all speak destination from one palette. Not the rejected white wash.
- Checkpoint = the camera firing: `SetCheckpoint` plays the film-advance ratchet (not a generic chime), so the end-screen contact sheet is audibly made of these moments. SoftFlash reused.
- R0/R1 hint de-dup (text only): R0 → vertical develop, R1 → horizontal "walk its length".

**Phase 2 — KEYSTONE: R3 repurposed into the FixPlatform debut ("THE LATENT IMAGE"):** added a `FixDef` struct + `fixPlats[]` on `RoomDef` and one builder-loop line calling the existing public `Latent()` helper; rebuilt R3 — deleted its 3 DarkPath steps, authored two latent slabs as a developed climb (39.8/1.8 → 41.2/3.3, flush onto R4) plus a non-lethal catch. First slab sits above the ~2.49 jump apex so printing is mandatory; the second is out of print-range from the floor so the first must be climbed (the rule reads as a rule). Cures the R0/R1/R3 triple-teach AND rescues the stranded mechanic in one commit (no no-op plumbing).

**Phase 3 — R10 alternate latent route (data-only, plumbing now exists):** one latent slab at R10's opening crossing (147.5/4.3) so the capstone can be crossed by PRINTING or DRAWING — drawer-vs-printer expression; both routes kept, exit never gated on the new one; "draw your own way across" softened to "cross by your own hand."

**Phase 4 — teach UmbralBarrier before the finale:** added `R9_ThresholdUmbra` at x142 on StairsUpB (past the blackout relight at 138.5 so the player has control), threshold 0.3 matching R10 so the exam ≤ the lesson; "the dark fights back" caps R9 with rising tension into frame 11 (the trust-fall + margin notes still land first). R9 gets the full teach hint; R10's umbral hint demoted to a terse reprise.

**Phase 5 — narrative binding (ship-only-if-it-lands):**
- *The shades wear her photographs:* the middle R9 corridor shade now cradles one of the player's OWN captured frames (frame 5, "First Stroke"), fetched lazily from `PhotoAlbum.Shot`, developing in off the existing `_glintAlpha` proximity ramp, self-lit so it reads in the blackout, degrading to nothing if the album missed it.
- *The blank frame already holds her:* a faint (0.12α) "always latent" self-portrait ghost on the win-screen photo paper from the moment it's revealed, the full portrait developing in over it — the prologue's blank-paper door, answered.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/PlayerController.cs` (accel ramp + variable jump), `Core/DarkroomInput.cs` (`JumpHeld`), `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (fall-scaled squash), `UI/HUDController.cs` (`SwitchFlash` + flash palette), `Core/GameManager.cs` (checkpoint → film-advance), `Level/LevelData.cs` (`FixDef` struct + `fixPlats[]` field; R0/R1 hints; R3 rebuilt; R10 latent + softened hint; R9 umbral + teach hint; R10 umbral hint demoted), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (fixPlats build loop → existing `Latent()`), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (DarkPath 10→7, umbrals 1→2, hints 17→18, new `fixPlats==3` check, fixPlats added to the derived child count), `World/ScriptedBlackout.cs` (middle shade holds frame 5), `UI/WinScreen.cs` (latent self-portrait bookend). No new files (edits only → no new metas).

### Deferred (deliberately, with rationale)
- **R10 horizontal trim** — closing the dead corridor (PostFloor x161.3 → AnchorB x166.25) requires shifting AnchorB/FinalCeiling/BurnFinal/ExitPlatform/guard/exit left, i.e. exactly the interlocking sensor/door/burn/umbral/patrol cluster the plan forbids moving. No safe automated trim exists; left byte-stable for hand-tuning in-engine.
- **Prologue self-portrait ghost** (other half of the bookend) — needs a per-renderer alpha path in `PrologueDirector` (its Overlays share one OverlayMax); the finale bookend alone lands the theme.
- **Mid-game contact-strip develop at checkpoint** — optional; needs a PhotoAlbum capture callback + spoiler/clutter tuning; the Phase-1 shutter reskin already gives the capture an audible beat.

### Rejected (from the adversarial pass)
Player-drawn R8 light bridge (physically impossible — strokes are feet-laid while walking, can't span a void); R9 mid-air mirror-lift handoff & time-pressured umbral gate (rejected twitch play); R3 twin dark staircase (more of the redundant lesson); R7 dual-solution (undercuts its enemy-puzzle intent); R4 master-skip.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`) after every phase. Validator literals re-derived from the data and matched (DarkPath 7, umbrals 2, hints 18, fixPlats 3; the object-count delta nets to +3 on both expected and actual). Batchmode validator NOT run — the Editor is open (lockfile present). No new files (no new metas). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Feel: starts/stops carry weight, a quick Space tap is a hop, the R9 drop lands heavy, the switch flash leans toward the state you pick, checkpoints sound like the shutter. Frame 4 "THE LATENT IMAGE" — flash OVER (3) by a ghost slab to PRINT permanent footing and climb to R4 (mistime it → drop to the catch; the prints stay). R10 opening — draw a bridge OR print the latent slab, your call. R9 threshold — a shade seals the way up; lay a drawn light stroke at its foot (R10's is now the reprise); passing the middle shade in the dark, it cradles your own frame-5 photo. Win screen — the warm paper is faintly her before it fully develops. Feel-check / easy to cut if they don't land: the held photo's legibility in the blackout (alpha/size/material), the win-screen latent ghost's 0.12 alpha, and whether the R9 umbral hurts the trust-fall mood (fallback: move that teach into R3's payload). Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed; the R10 trim is left for hand-tuning in-engine.)

## Interaction 72 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-22
**Development Stage:** Narrative documentation — story-conceptualization doc for the course (Milestone 20, non-code)
**Current Goal:** A teacher-required doc that conceptualizes the game's story across five layers (Cultural Background/Elements · Visual · Audio · Other Media/Art references · Space configuration), with real references, handable to "Claude Design."

### Student Prompt
"The teacher also asked for a doc … to conceptualize a story for your game" with layers of Cultural Background/Elements, Visual elements, Audio elements, Other Media/Art references (Movies/Games/Novels), Space configuration. "Find some useful and relative information, and give me a markdown or prompt so I can hand it over to Claude Design."

### Agent Response Summary
First grounded in the *existing* implicit story by reading the narrative-bearing code — `LevelData` (11 frame titles, hints, margin notes, EXIF caption), `WinScreen` (latent self-portrait bookend + contact-sheet develop), `PrologueDirector` (safelight/work-light + the blank 11th frame), `ScriptedBlackout` (the corridor shade that cradles the player's own frame-5 photo), and `art-pipeline/ART_DIRECTION.md` (the locked palette). Then ran an **ultracode Workflow** (8 agents, ~341k tokens): six parallel web-research agents (cultural · visual · audio · games · film+lit · space), a reference fact-check pass, and a narrative-spine synthesis. 57 references collected; fact-check applied three corrections (CMA *PROOF* contact-sheet exhibition = **2020** not 2019/2017; Calvino's *The Adventure of a Photographer* = **short story** not essay; Plato's cave = **philosophy/dialogue**).

Authored **`STORY_CONCEPT.md`** at the project root: logline + premise + themes table; the five required layers (each = concept → fact-checked reference table → motifs → directives → pitfalls), grounded in the actual mechanics + the locked `#0D0D0F`/`#3A4A8C→#9FD8E6`/`#FFF3D6`/`#8B1A1A` palette; an 11-frame "story beat fused to mechanic" table; and a self-contained **copy-paste hand-off prompt for Claude Design**. Core through-line articulated and named: the **latent image** (she's already in the blank frame), **Under = the most beautiful state** (Tanizaki, not "scary dark"), the **single red as a double sign** (safe ↔ waking-shade threat, CineStill halation physics), shades as the **Jungian shadow-self** (grief, not monsters), commitment/irreversibility as **fixer chemistry**, and the ending as **recognition not twist** (Barthes' punctum / *Walter Mitty* negative #25).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New file `STORY_CONCEPT.md` (documentation only — no code, no scripts, no mechanics touched). This log entry. Offline build untouched.

### Immediate Result
Doc delivered. No engine impact; nothing to compile or validate. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(Hand `STORY_CONCEPT.md` — or just the §7 "Hand-off prompt" code block — to Claude Design. Everything is grounded in what's already shipped, so it reads as "name why each choice works + where to push," not a redesign. Key levers if the teacher wants emphasis: the §6 frame table is the fastest read of the whole story; the reference tables are all real and dated for citation. Nothing in the game changed.)

## Interaction 73 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** "The roll finishes developing" — richer, not longer (Milestone 20)
**Current Goal:** Student asked whether eleven frames is too short / not rich enough, and to add elements — "something from Unity's side, not just relying on the scripts." Decided NOT to lengthen the roll (kept 11), and to DEEPEN it along three composed threads the student chose: a recontextualizing late beat (colour), secrets + a darkroom hub, and Unity-side production.

### Student Prompt
will eleven frames be too short? I still feel the content is not rich enough. Or think about what elements can add. I can also add something from the Unity's side, not just relying on the scripts or the codes. (Chose: emphasis = recontextualizing late beat + secrets/hub + Unity-side production; left the roll at 11.)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed first (3 deep designers, each grounded in the code, → adversarial feasibility/scope critique → synthesis). Reframed "too short" as DENSITY, not duration, and found a unifying through-line: the run has been an UNDEVELOPED roll, so richness = letting more of it **develop**. The same word now drives all three threads.

**D1 — Colour, the recontextualizing beat (MVP + the in-world R10 "wash" verb).**
- *MVP (`UI/WinScreen.cs`):* the self-portrait develops from a cold blue-grey to a warm, saturated tint over the last ~0.8s of the 1.9s develop (chroma held back so it BLOOMS, not fades); the bookend latent ghost is nudged cold so the warm-up reads. The whole monochrome roll re-reads as "undeveloped; only the frame with her in it develops in colour."
- *FULL (the wash as a VERB):* a doorless LocalLux "wash tray" by the R10 exit (`R10_WashTray`, threshold 0.4 > the player's own glow so only a drawn stroke trips it), reusing the proven LocalLux idiom. Lay a bright stroke on it → `PostFXDirector.BeginColorWash()` floods the world with colour (a persistent saturation-positive + filter-neutralising layer applied ON TOP of the exposure grade AND the finale flare, so frame 11 is captured in colour intentionally) AND `GameManager.DoColorWash()` unseals the exit (`LevelExit.RequiresWash`). Colour is the last verb she spends. Added a generic `onActivated` hook to `PhotoSensor` so the builder attaches the bloom to that one meter; the finale capture stays correct because the wash precedes BeginFinale.

**D2 — Secrets + darkroom hub (4 lost frames + gallery).** New `LostDef`/`lostFrames[]` on RoomDef mirroring `FixDef`; a `Lost()` builder modeled on `Latent()` (exactly ONE root child); `LostFrame.cs` trigger → captures into a SEPARATE `PhotoAlbum._lost` list (the sacred `_shots[11]` + the 11-slot contact strip are untouched by construction), bumps `GameManager.LostFound`, sparkle + develop sound + a "LOST FRAME DEVELOPED n/total" note. Four verb-gated pockets, one per verb — Under (R1, above the dark trail), draw (R5, above the pad), Over (R8, above the light bridge), print (R10, above the latent span). A live darkroom GALLERY rebuilt in the pause panel each time it opens; a "you kept N you'd forgotten." coda under the win screen. Named "lost frame" NOT "negative" (collision with the Under-unlock banner / R8's name).

**D3 — Unity-side: a hand-written develop shader.** `Assets/Resources/SpriteDevelop.shader` — a URP-2D unlit sprite shader (ShaderLab/HLSL, not Shader Graph) with a `_Develop` (0..1) noise-thresholded dissolve + a warm halation front, `Fallback "Sprites/Default"`. Exposed via a guarded `VisualFactory.DevelopMat` (Shader.Find + new Material; returns null if absent → never pink), driven 0→1 through a `MaterialPropertyBlock` in `PlayerAnimator.DevelopRoutine` so the most-seen beat in the game — the respawn "burned print re-develops" — becomes a chemical-bath wipe instead of a flat alpha fade. Verified the hybrid is clean: 59 renderers assign their material from VisualFactory, and `Assets/Resources/` already exists (FontLoader proves Resources.Load), so an authored material drops in via the existing pattern.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/WinScreen.cs` (colour develop + lost coda), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (BeginColorWash + persistent wash layer + reset), `Core/GameManager.cs` (ExitWashed/DoColorWash, LostFound, resets), `World/PhotoSensor.cs` (onActivated hook), `World/LevelExit.cs` (RequiresWash seal), `Core/PhotoAlbum.cs` (_lost list + CaptureLost/LostShot + Clear), `World/LostFrame.cs` (NEW), `Level/LevelData.cs` (LostDef + lostFrames + LostFrameTotal; SensorDef.wash variant; 4 lost-frame placements; R10 wash tray + hint), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (Lost() builder + loop; wash-sensor branch; exit RequiresWash), `Core/VisualFactory.cs` (DevelopMat), `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (shader-driven develop), `Assets/Resources/SpriteDevelop.shader` (NEW), `UI/HUDController.cs` (ShowLostFrame + pause gallery), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (lostFrames==4, sensors 3→4, hints 18→19, wash-sensor door-resolve skip, defChildren += lostFrames). Two new files have hand-made metas.

### Deferred / Cut (with reason)
2D skeletal rig (lowest impact/hour, breaks the procedural-character identity), Timeline (can't bind to runtime-created objects), VFX Graph (not installed; URP-2D-fragile — Shuriken is the fallback if FX is wanted), Cinemachine vcam, second-exposure routes, completionist score. Authored field-recording ambience is near-free (clone `AudioDirector.LoadMusic` for a `/ambience` folder) and can slot in anytime.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`) after every stage and all together. Every validator literal re-derived from the data and matched (lost frames 4, sensors 4, hints 19, latent 3, umbrals 2, doors 3, DarkPath 7); each new builder makes exactly ONE root child so the object-count cross-check stays balanced. Batchmode validator NOT run (Editor open / lockfile present). **Shader render-correctness is the one thing the offline check can't confirm — it's an in-editor verification; the guarded null/Fallback path means a compile/strip failure degrades to the old alpha fade, never pink.** Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Win screen: the self-portrait now warms into colour while the cold contact strip stays undeveloped. Respawn anywhere: the print should re-develop as a grainy dissolve (if it looks like a plain fade, the shader didn't compile — check the Console; it's safe either way). Hidden LOST FRAMES — Under above R1's trail, draw above R5's pad, Over above R8's light bridge, print above R10's latent slab; pause (Esc) to see the darkroom gallery fill; the win screen adds "you kept N you'd forgotten." R10 ending: past the guard, go OVER and lay a bright stroke on the wash tray by the exit — colour floods the world and the door unseals (the exit does nothing until you do). Things to feel-check / tune in-engine: the develop shader's look (grain scale / halation in `Resources/SpriteDevelop.shader`); the 4 lost-frame pockets' REACHABILITY (verify each needs its verb and never blocks the path — dev-warp `[` `]`); the wash-tray threshold 0.4 and its position 173 past the guard at 171.5 (raise/move if the awake guard makes it unfair); whether the colour reveal reads as clearly distinct from the existing warm finale flare. Run the batchmode validator once the Editor is closed. Cut anything that doesn't land — every piece degrades gracefully.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 74 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Playtest fixes — the "purple door" + the R9 drop (Milestone 20.1)
**Current Goal:** Three pieces of playtest feedback: (1) the drawn-light-trail "purple door" reads strange — redesign it; (2) reset to Normal on arriving at R9 so the drop isn't trivial when you cross in still Underexposed; (3) stop horizontal air-control during the R9 free-fall so you can't fly across the void and skip the lift.

### Student Prompt
the light trail to activate the purple door seems a little bit strange, redesign the purple door as something else. And at R9(the jumping elevator), reset the status to normal before jumping or it will be too easy to jump down because the previous status might be underexposed. And do not let the user to move right while dropping, otherwise the user can just fly to the right without the elevator. (Chose: purple door → "walk through it in Over".)

### Agent Response Summary
- **Purple door → BLACKOUT CURTAIN (student chose "walk through in Over").** Rewrote `LevelBuilder.Umbral()`: dropped the light-driven `UmbralBarrier` + LightField + the roiling violet emulsion, and rebuilt it as a cold-dark hung curtain backed by a standard `ExposureObject` of type `BrightBarrier` — solid in Under/Normal, washed OPEN (passable + faded) in Over. No drawn trail; flood it with light (3) and step through. The existing exposure jam-rule prevents re-solidifying it on the player, so no custom anti-crush guard is needed. Both instances convert (R9 curtain debut + R10 reprise); hints + data comments rewritten ("flood it in Over and step through"). `UmbralBarrier.cs` + `AudioDirector.PlayUmbraOpen/Seal` are now dead code (left in place, harmless). Validator UNCHANGED: the `umbrals[]` data array is the same (count still 2), and the curtain isn't a `BoxDef`, so `barriers == 0` still holds and the object count stays balanced (one root child, as before).
- **R9 reset to Normal (`World/ScriptedBlackout.cs`).** A one-shot `_resetArmed`: when the player is grounded on the arrival ledge (x 125–127, y > 8), `ExposureManager.ForceSet(Normal, silent)` fires once. Coming in from R8's Under-only dark bridge no longer pre-arms the (Under-only) shadow lift — you must CHOOSE the dark to summon it. Re-armed on every respawn (`Abort`).
- **No fly-across during the drop (`World/ScriptedBlackout.cs`).** During the free-fall the player's x is CLAMPED to the lift's span (≤128.8; lift right edge ~129.2): you can still drift right enough to clear the shaft wall and settle onto the lift, but you can't air-control PAST it to the corridor (the old skip-the-lift exploit). A full horizontal LOCK was tried first and reverted — the shaft wall (x125.8–126.8, top 8.5) sits directly under the ledge's right edge, so a player who can't move right just lands on the wall instead of the void; the drop REQUIRES a small rightward drift, hence a clamp, not a lock. Releases the instant the lift catches you (grounded).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (Umbral → blackout-curtain BrightBarrier), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R9 + R10 umbral hints + comments), `World/ScriptedBlackout.cs` (arrival reset-to-Normal + free-fall x-clamp + Abort re-arm). No new files; no validator literal changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`); `AddComponent<UmbralBarrier>` refs now 0. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. R9: arriving from R8 you snap to Normal at the ledge — the way down only appears when you choose Under; mid-drop you can still nudge right onto the lift but can't fly past it to the corridor. The two "purple doors" (top of R9's stairs, and mid-R10) are now cold blackout curtains — switch to Over (3) and walk through; no more drawing a trail. Feel-checks: that the R9 reset-to-Normal doesn't feel abrupt (it's silent — say if you'd prefer the shutter-click feedback); that the curtain reads clearly as solid-then-open between Normal and Over; in R10 the curtain is intentionally soft since you're often already in Over — say the word if you'd rather it be removed there. `UmbralBarrier.cs` is now unused dead code — safe to delete in a cleanup pass.)

## Interaction 75 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Onboarding + one consistent vocabulary (Milestone 20.2)
**Current Goal:** Two pieces of feedback: (1) the start lacks any instruction for HOW to switch exposure; (2) the mode names change mid-game — keep them the same. Student chose ONE consistent set: UNDER / NORMAL / OVER everywhere.

### Student Prompt
the beginning part seems to lack the instruction of how to switch between the different exposure modes. And the name of modes would be better to keep the same, what do you think? (Chose: names = UNDER / NORMAL / OVER everywhere.)

### Agent Response Summary
- **Why the switch felt untaught:** Under is granted SILENTLY at boot (`Bootstrap.GrantNegativeSilently`), so — unlike Flash/Shutter — there is no acquire-banner. The only cue was the prologue's REACTIVE "1 — safelight", which appears *after* you press 1; if you don't know to press it, you never see it. Added a **proactive prompt** in `PrologueDirector.Update`: "Press 1 / 2 to change the exposure", surfaced ~5s in and repeated up to 3× until the player's first switch (`_switched`). Also made the R0 gap hint name the key ("…press 1, then climb what develops").
- **One vocabulary everywhere (was THREE):** the slider swapped SAFELIGHT/WORK LIGHT/ENLARGER FLASH → UNDER/BALANCED/OVER after the Flash; the badge/card said UNDEREXPOSED/NORMAL/OVEREXPOSED; banners said "press 1: UNDEREXPOSED" — so even at boot the slider ("SAFELIGHT") disagreed with the banner ("UNDEREXPOSED"), and the middle was "BALANCED" vs "NORMAL". Unified to **UNDER / NORMAL / OVER**: dropped the darkroom-action arrays + the vocab swap (`SetExposureVocab` → `RefreshExposureLabels`, which now only re-greys/un-greys the lock state), changed BALANCED→NORMAL, made the tutorial card always use the exposure names, and removed the per-restart label re-seed. The darkroom flavour (the red safelight, the enlarger, the trays) stays in the art/audio/narrative, not the functional labels. Prologue key-confirms are now "1 — under" / "2 — normal".

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (removed ActionLabels/ActionBadges/ActionBodies + `_exposureVocab`; `ExposureLabels` = UNDER/NORMAL/OVER; card always exposure-vocab; `SetExposureVocab`→`RefreshExposureLabels`; restart reset no longer re-seeds labels), `World/PrologueDirector.cs` (proactive switch prompt + "under"/"normal" confirms), `Level/LevelData.cs` (R0 gap hint names the key). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`); grep confirms zero residual refs to the removed vocab symbols. Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. From the first frame the slider/badge/banners/hints all read UNDER · NORMAL · OVER (no more mid-game name change, no BALANCED). In the prologue a "Press 1 / 2 to change the exposure" prompt now appears a few seconds in and repeats until you first switch, and the gap hint says "press 1" outright. Tunables if it's too much/little: prompt timing + repeat count in `PrologueDirector` (`_promptT` 5s start / 7s repeat, `_promptsLeft` 3). If you ever want the darkroom-action flavour back as a SUBTITLE under the exposure name, say so — it's a small additive change now that there's a single source of truth.)

## Interaction 76 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Title typography + a clickable exposure bar (Milestone 20.3)
**Current Goal:** Two UI feedback items: (1) the top-left level name reads like UI (same font as everything else) — make it a TITLE (cursive); (2) testers reach for the exposure bar with the mouse — make it clickable + draggable between modes.

### Student Prompt
and the level name is on the top left corner right now, which can not be distinguished from other UI, they feel too familiar. Make it into some Cursive writing font or else so that it will be more look like a title rather than UI. Also, during the user testing, they will try to click the exposure bar, I think it will be good to make it clickable and also can slide between the modes.

### Agent Response Summary
- **Cursive level-name title.** Added `FontLoader.Title` — a script/cursive face with a graceful fallback chain (bundled `Resources/Fonts/Title` → Snell Roundhand / Apple Chancery / Zapfino / Segoe Script / Brush Script → Display → Mono). The top-left `_roomTitle` now uses it at size 30, title-cased ("Frame 4 of 11 :  The Latent Image" instead of mono caps "FRAME 4 OF 11 : THE LATENT IMAGE"), so it reads as a hand-written photo caption, clearly distinct from the Mono objectives/HUD. Nudged the objectives down (−74→−86) for the taller title. The centered ceremonial frame-card (Display caps) is left as-is.
- **Clickable / draggable exposure bar.** This runtime HUD has NO EventSystem/GraphicRaycaster, so rather than stand up the whole UGUI event stack I poll the mouse directly (new `DarkroomInput.PointerPressed/Held/Pos`). `HUDController.HandleSliderPointer()` (in the existing Update): on a press that lands inside the slider rect it starts a drag; while held it maps the pointer to the NEAREST mode label (via `RectTransformUtility.WorldToScreenPoint`/`RectangleContainsScreenPoint`, null camera — correct for the ScreenSpaceOverlay+CanvasScaler canvas) and switches through `ExposureManager.TrySetExposure` only when the nearest slot CHANGES — so a drag slides Under→Normal→Over and clicks jump straight to a mode. Goes through the exact same gated path as the keys, so locks (OVER before Flash) and the jam rule still apply, and it's suppressed while paused / cinematic / respawning / won.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/FontLoader.cs` (new `Title` cursive face), `UI/HUDController.cs` (room title → cursive + title-case, objectives nudged, `HandleSliderPointer` + `ToTitle`), `Core/DarkroomInput.cs` (`using UnityEngine` + mouse pointer helpers). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The level name top-left is now a cursive title (on this Mac it should resolve to Snell Roundhand; bundle `Resources/Fonts/Title.ttf` to pin it across machines). The exposure bar: click a mode to jump to it, or press-and-drag across to slide Under↔Normal↔Over — locked OVER still jam-shakes until the Flash, same as the key. Tunables: title font size (30) / fallback faces in `FontLoader.Title`; if you'd rather only the NAME be cursive and keep "Frame N of 11" as small mono UI above it, that's a quick split. If clicks ever feel slightly off-target, it's the screen↔canvas mapping — tell me the resolution and I'll adjust. The frame-card on room entry was left in the Display caps face; say if you want it cursive too.)

## Interaction 77 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** HUD elegance pass — liquid-glass exposure bar (Milestone 20.4)
**Current Goal:** From a screenshot: (1) the exposure bar is too plain — add a "liquid glass" feel; (2) the cursive level name reads well but is too small; (3) the top-right A/D control text is too eye-catching — grey it down to a faded hint.

### Student Prompt
this still feels not elegant enough, such as the exposure bar too simple, I think maybe can add some liquid glass effect? And the level name looks good, but too small. The A/D words could be more grey and not so eye-catching, so serve as a faded hint.

### Agent Response Summary
- **Liquid-glass exposure bar.** A true background-blur "glass" would need a scene grab-pass the overlay HUD can't cheaply get, so I built a layered FAKE that reads as frosted glass with no new shader. Added `PixelArt.RoundedRect` — a 9-sliced rounded-rectangle sprite (rounded-rect SDF, AA edge, 16px corner border) that tints + stretches without distorting corners. Rebuilt `BuildExposureSlider` as a glass module, back-to-front: a soft `SoftGlow` drop-shadow (depth), a cool edge catch-light rim, a frosted semi-transparent rounded body (0.11/0.13/0.17 @ 0.5α), a top sheen bar, then the EXPOSURE caption, a rounded frosted track pill, a GLOSSY knob (now a slider container = warm `SoftGlow` halo + disc body + a specular highlight dot), and the labels/locks on top. `_knob` is now a container `RectTransform` (MoveKnob still slides it by anchoredPosition; the clickable-slider polling is unaffected).
- **Bigger title.** Cursive room name 30 → 42 pt; widened its box and pushed the objectives down (−86 → −104) so nothing overlaps.
- **Faded controls.** Top-right control hint greyed from 0.72 → 0.45 and its group alpha 0.65 → 0.55 (incl. the two fade-restore lerps + the restart reset), so it reads as a quiet hint, not active UI.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (new `RoundedRect` 9-slice sprite), `UI/HUDController.cs` (glass-layered `BuildExposureSlider` + glossy container knob; room title 42pt + objectives nudge; controls colour 0.45 + alpha 0.55 across the three references). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The exposure bar is now a frosted-glass slab — rounded body, edge catch-light, top sheen, and a glossy haloed knob; still click/drag to switch. Tunables (all in `BuildExposureSlider`): glass body alpha 0.5, rim 0.16, sheen 0.10, knob halo 0.4 + size 66, corner radius in `PixelArt.RoundedRect` (16 of 48). Title is 42pt now; controls are a faint grey (colour 0.45 / alpha 0.55) — dial either further if you want. If you'd like the glass to actually refract the scene behind it, that's a bigger job (a camera grab-pass + blur shader feeding the UI) — say the word and I'll scope it.)

## Interaction 78 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Exposure bar — just the slide bar as glass (Milestone 20.5)
**Current Goal:** The full frosted-glass PANEL wrapping the whole module read as strange. Student wants only the slide BAR itself to look like glass, and as TRANSPARENT COLOURED glass.

### Student Prompt
too strange for the exposure bar, I just need the slide bar itself to be like glass, and it should be transparent color glass

### Agent Response Summary
Removed the whole glass module (the SoftGlow shadow, the catch-light rim, the frosted body, the top-sheen panel) and the big warm knob halo, and restored the clean original layout (caption y0, track y−38, labels y−64). The TRACK is now the only glass element: a rounded translucent **tinted pill** — cool blue (0.58/0.72/0.95) at **0.28α** so the background shows through (transparent coloured glass) — with a thin bright top-edge **sheen** (white 0.30α) for the glassy highlight. The knob is a clean bright translucent disc + a small specular dot (no halo). Click/drag-to-switch and `_knob`-as-container are unchanged.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (`BuildExposureSlider` simplified: glass panel removed, track = transparent tinted glass pill + sheen, clean disc knob). `PixelArt.RoundedRect` kept (still used by the track + sheen). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Now ONLY the slide bar is glass: a transparent cool-blue tinted pill you can see through, with a bright sheen line on top; clean disc handle; no panel. Tunables in `BuildExposureSlider`: track tint/alpha `(0.58,0.72,0.95, 0.28)` — push alpha lower for clearer glass or change the RGB for a different glass colour; sheen `0.30`; track height `12`. Say if you want the glass tint to shift with the mode — cool in Under, warm in Over.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 79 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Exposure bar — neutral baked glass rod (Milestone 20.6)
**Current Goal:** The tinted pill still read strange and the blue cast was unwanted. Student wants a PURELY glass feeling, neutral (no colour), and is happy with an "advanced texture" to make it look nice.

### Student Prompt
still strange, why there's a blue color? Make it purely glass feeling, you can add some advanced texture if needed, I want the effect to be nice

### Agent Response Summary
Replaced the flat tinted-pill-plus-sheen with a proper baked GLASS TEXTURE. New `PixelArt.GlassBar`: a 720×32 horizontal stadium (rounded caps) whose ALPHA carries a top-lit glass profile — a faint translucent body (0.10), a crisp Gaussian specular highlight near the top (peak 0.92 @ v≈0.78), and a soft bottom rim (0.22 @ v≈0.16) — with a subtle neutral top-lit brightness gradient (0.80→1.0). Fully greyscale, so tinted white it has ZERO colour cast; rendered Simple at 360×16 (2:1) so the caps and gradient stay crisp. The track now uses it (white tint, no separate gloss element), and the knob disc was de-blued (was 0.92/0.95/1.0 → neutral 0.97). The old `RoundedRect` helper is left in place (unused now, harmless public utility).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (new `GlassBar` baked-glass sprite), `UI/HUDController.cs` (track → `GlassBar`, white tint, removed the tinted pill + sheen; neutral knob disc). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Not committed.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The bar should now read as a clear, neutral glass rod — a bright reflection line catching the top, a faint see-through body, a soft glow along the bottom edge, rounded ends — no blue. Tunables in `PixelArt.GlassBar`: `spec` 0.92 (highlight strength), `body` 0.10 (how see-through), `rim` 0.22 (bottom edge); track height 16 in `BuildExposureSlider`. If you want REAL refraction — the bar actually bending/blurring the scene behind it — that needs a camera grab-pass + a blur/refraction shader feeding the UI; it's a bigger job but doable, just say so.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 80 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Exposure bar — TRUE refraction glass (Milestone 20.7)
**Current Goal:** Build real refraction (the bar bends/blurs the scene behind it), and fix the "two layers" feel — the baked texture stacked a flat highlight on a flat body instead of shading like a solid glass rod.

### Student Prompt
build the true refraction. Another problem is that is still feels like two layers rather than a real glass right now

### Agent Response Summary
Built a real grab-and-refract pipeline, code-only (no URP renderer-asset edits):
- **Scene grab (`Core/GlassRefraction.cs`):** a manager (added in `Bootstrap` before the HUD) subscribes to `RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering` and, for the main camera (after the world + post-processing, BEFORE the overlay HUD draws → no self-feedback), `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture` into a screen-sized RT, fed to the glass material as `_GrabTex`. Recreates the RT on resize; degrades to null material (→ baked-glass fallback) if the shader is absent.
- **Refraction + cylindrical glass shader (`Resources/GlassRefract.shader`, UI/CG):** computes a rounded-capsule mask from the quad UV (so a plain `RawImage` is enough), models the bar as a horizontal glass ROD cross-section (`c` = −1..1, fullness `n = √(1−c²)`), bends the captured-scene sample vertically by the surface tilt (`_Refract`) and frosts it with a 5-tap blur, then composites ONE continuous tone (refracted bg × tint, thicker centre darker) + a crisp top sheen + a Fresnel edge rim. Neutral, no colour cast. `Fallback "UI/Default"`.
- **Wiring:** the track is now a `RawImage` with the glass material (fallback: an `Image` with the baked `PixelArt.GlassBar`). The "two layers" is fixed by the continuous `n`-based shading + the rim — it reads as a solid rod, refraction or not.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW `Resources/GlassRefract.shader`, NEW `Core/GlassRefraction.cs` (both with hand-made metas), `Core/Bootstrap.cs` (+`GlassRefraction` manager), `UI/HUDController.cs` (track → RawImage + glass material, baked fallback). Updated the `darkroom-project` memory's csc command (now needs `UnityEngine.ScreenCaptureModule.dll`). No validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`) with the added ScreenCapture module ref. Shader render-correctness is an in-editor check (the guarded null/UI-Default fallback keeps it safe).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P — ⌘R matters here so Unity imports the NEW shader; until it does, the bar uses the baked-glass fallback. Watch the bar over a bright spot (the EXPOSURE text / a lamp) to see it bend + frost. Honest caveats to check in-editor: (1) `ScreenCapture` timing under URP may capture a frame late or, worst case, include the HUD — if you see the bar faintly showing itself, tell me and I'll switch the grab to a CommandBuffer blit; (2) the grab may be Y-flipped on some setups — if the refraction bends the wrong way it's a one-line UV flip; (3) over the near-black backdrop the effect is subtle by nature. Tunables in `GlassRefract.shader`: `_Refract` 0.02, `_Blur` 0.004, `_Spec` 1.5, `_Rim` 0.8, `_Tint`. If you'd rather the glass also tint with the exposure (cool/warm), that's a small add.)

## Interaction 81 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-23
**Development Stage:** Glass tint tracks the exposure (Milestone 20.7a)
**Current Goal:** Make the glass bar's tint shift with the exposure mode.

### Student Prompt
yeah sure, make the glass tint shift with the exposure mode

### Agent Response Summary
`GlassRefraction` now subscribes to `ExposureManager.OnExposureChanged` and lerps the shader's `_Tint` toward a per-mode colour — cool (0.78/0.86/1.0) in Under, neutral (0.94/0.96/0.99) in Normal, warm (1.0/0.92/0.80) in Over — over ~0.2s, set on the material in `Update`. The tint multiplies only the refracted glass BODY; the specular sheen + Fresnel rim stay white, so it reads as tinted glass, not a coloured filter. Unsubscribed in `OnDestroy`. (Applies on the refraction-shader path; the baked-glass fallback stays neutral.)

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/GlassRefraction.cs` (exposure-driven `_Tint` lerp). No new files; no validator changes.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The glass bar now drifts cool when you go Under, warm when you go Over, neutral at Normal — a soft ~0.2s blend. Tunables in `GlassRefraction`: the three `Tint*` colours and the lerp speed (5). Push the colours further from white for a stronger tint.)

## Interaction 82 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** Craft-chain reframe — dramatize FIX (R3), choreograph THE DROP (R9), confirm the R6 dual-use light (Milestone 21)

**Current Goal:** Reframe the three exposures as a darkroom craft chain (Under = DISCOVERY, Normal = JUDGMENT, Over = COMMITMENT) and, instead of adding objects, deepen three existing signature beats: make FIX/定影 the first stunning "I changed the photo" moment (R3), make THE DROP a remembered set-piece rather than a puzzle (R9), and verify R6's "one stroke = ladder + key" actually works.

### Student Prompt
(Design brief: turn 1/2/3 into three psychological crafts — Under/Safelight = 发现 (develop, see hidden paths, shadows hold you), Normal/Work-light = 判断 (read the true structure: permanent vs image vs burnable), Over/Flash = 承诺 (burn, fix, irreversible, costly). Don't add new objects — build 3 designed combination beats around the existing BurnPaper/FixPlatform/ShadowLift/RiseLift/UmbralBarrier. R3: make the print DEVELOP like paper (grain→outline→solid) and leave a permanent mark. R6: light-trail as ladder AND key (already affirmed). R9: keep slow/vicious/poetic — caught by shadow, lights out, world quiet, like INSIDE/LIMBO; don't stuff in more mechanisms.)

### Agent Response Summary
Mapped the brief onto the codebase (5-agent read) before touching anything: the craft chain is already the spine (`ExposureManager` enum + subscribers), and two of the three beats were already built. Then:
- **R3 — FixPlatform print, dramatized (`World/FixPlatform.cs`):** the print was a flat 0.5s alpha crossfade that ignored the project's own `Resources/SpriteDevelop.shader` (a grain-threshold dissolve with a warm halation front). Re-pointed `DevelopIn()` at `VisualFactory.DevelopMat`, driving `_Develop` 0→1 over **1.1s via a `MaterialPropertyBlock`** (per-renderer, so two slabs printing at once don't share the shared material's `_Develop` — same idiom as `PlayerAnimator.DevelopRoutine`). The slab warms from the cool latent negative to a developed-paper tint as the image surfaces; a second warm spark fires as the front crosses the middle; the collider still flips on instantly (commit = footing now). **Permanent mark:** the grain veil settles to a faint warm **emulsion residual** (alpha 0.10) that never fully clears, and the slab keeps a warm `PrintedTint` — so printed footing reads as a developed print forever, visually distinct from native cool-grey ground (this also carries the Normal=JUDGMENT "read the structure" idea through visual language, no UI). Null-safe: if the shader is absent it falls back to the old alpha fade.
- **R9 — THE DROP, choreographed catch (`World/ShadowLift.cs`, `World/ScriptedBlackout.cs`, `Level/LevelBuilder.cs`):** the set-piece already had wind / camera-lag / lamp-flicker→blackout / ambience-duck / sleeping shades; what was missing was the **catch** as a beat. Added a **catch-hang** to `ShadowLift` (0.45s held breath as the shadow takes her weight before it sinks) and slowed the descent (`sinkSpeed` 1.6 → **1.1**, set at the build site) for dread. In `ScriptedBlackout` added a one-shot **CAUGHT gate**: the instant she's grounded on the lift in the shaft (Under), the world holds its breath — wind settles to a low draught (0.12), ambience half-ducks (0.5), a low hum nudge — and **exposure locks** (`SetLocked(true)`): for once the slider is taken out of her hands so she can't let the light back in and drop herself. The lock + hush hand off cleanly to the existing corridor blackout on touchdown; `Abort()`/`Restore()` release them and re-arm on any respawn that hasn't reached the blackout. The lift *mechanic* is unchanged (the vanish-on-relight risk still exists in isolation) — only R9's orchestration chooses to lock.
- **R6 — confirmed, no change:** verified in code that the drawn bright stroke is simultaneously the climbable ladder (its `EdgeCollider2D` joins the ground mask on `Fix()`) and the meter key (only `BrightStroke` registers a `LightField` emitter). Numbers hold: climb-stroke ≈0.53–0.55 lux at the wall meter vs 0.4 threshold; body-glow peaks 0.35 (below threshold) → a real stroke is forced; 3-stroke budget + permanent `Door_R6L` + `CP_R6b` make it soft-lock-proof.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`World/FixPlatform.cs` (SpriteDevelop shader reveal + permanent emulsion/print mark, 1.1s), `World/ShadowLift.cs` (catch-hang), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (`Lift()` sinkSpeed 1.1), `World/ScriptedBlackout.cs` (caught beat: hush + exposure-lock, with abort/restore cleanup). No new files (no metas needed). No validator change — all decoration is child-of-object, not child-of-root, and no def counts moved.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Editor was open → batchmode validator deferred (no data counts changed, so it should stay green). Two design forks left open for the student: (1) how far to take Normal=JUDGMENT (visual-language only vs a held "read" overlay vs world labels); (2) whether to relocate R9's curtain/UmbralBarrier teach out of the drop's tail (would update the validator `umbrals`/`hints` literals).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P — ⌘R matters so Unity recompiles. **R3:** flash OVER (3) next to a ghost slab and watch it develop out of the grain with a warm front, then stay marked; tunables in `FixPlatform` — `DevelopDur` 1.1, `PrintedTint`, `EmulsionResidual`. **R9:** go Under (1) at the ledge and drop — the shadow now catches and *holds* for a breath, the room hushes, the slider locks, and it sinks slowly to the corridor before the lights die; tunables — `ShadowLift.CatchHang` 0.45, `sinkSpeed` 1.1 in `LevelBuilder.Lift()`, and the catch hush in `ScriptedBlackout`. If you'd rather keep the old mid-descent vanish risk, the one-line `SetLocked(true)` in the CAUGHT gate is the thing to drop.)

### Student Decision (same interaction) + follow-through
Asked the two open forks; student chose both recommended:
- **Normal=JUDGMENT → visual-language only.** No new mechanic — the R3 print-mark + existing material identities (cool-grey native ground, white burnable paper, faint ghosts) + hold-to-preview already carry "read the true structure." Nothing further built.
- **R9 curtain → pulled out of the drop.** Removed `R9_ThresholdUmbra` + its teach hint from `LevelData` so THE DROP ends as a pure set-piece (trust-fall → dark walk → relight → stairs → finale, no gate). R10's `R10_PostUmbra` is now the curtain's only appearance; reworded R10's hint from "One more curtain…" to a first-teach ("A blackout curtain — flood it in Over (3) and step through."). Updated the validator literals: `umbrals 2→1`, `hints 19→18` (the built-object-count check auto-tracks from data). Tier-1 `csc` clean.

## Interaction 83 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** R6 legibility — the light meter sleeps under the safelight (Milestone 21.1)
**Current Goal:** Make R6's "draw a stroke to trip the meter" beat feel natural and stop players asking "why can't I activate it in Under?"

### Student Prompt
(那个跳起来画一笔来触发传感器的设计怎么做再精妙合理一点？现在总感觉不够自然，而且用户会想着在 under 模式下跳为什么不能激活)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed the "why not Under?" confusion to a concrete cause: the player's body glow is a **constant** `LightField` emitter (`PlayerController.cs:61` — radius 1.5, intensity 0.35) that was **NOT gated by exposure mode**. So the cyan light-meter's iris half-filled from mere presence **identically in Under/Normal/Over**, and a dark stroke added nothing (only `BrightStroke` registers as light) — leaving a teasing partial reading the safelight could never complete and no signal that Over was required. **Fix (`PlayerController.cs`):** gated the body-glow's puzzle-light contribution to **Over only** (the lambda now returns `glow.intensity` only when `ExposureManager.Current == Overexposed`, else 0). The fiction justifies it perfectly — a *safelight* is by definition the light that does not expose, so a light meter ignoring it is the most darkroom-true rule in the game. Now every meter and curtain stays cold in Under/Normal no matter how you climb or what dark stroke you draw; in Over the body glow gives an "almost" tease that a drawn bright stroke finishes. Vision is untouched (the Light2D still shines 0.35, so Under is never blind). Verified only `PhotoSensor` (meters/wash) + `UmbralBarrier` (curtains) consume `LightField`, and all are Over-deliveries — so the gate is safe and also makes the curtains provably Over-only.

Left the "feels unnatural" half as a design fork for the student: the vertical jump-and-draw fights the draw verb (strokes lay at the feet during horizontal motion, so the natural product is a horizontal bridge, not a vertical ladder). Options offered: (A) reframe to a horizontal bridge-of-light whose path bathes the meter [recommended], (B) keep the vertical climb but make it forgiving, (C) decouple climb from key, (D) leave the geometry and ship the gate (+ optional iris sleep/wake visual).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/PlayerController.cs` (body-glow `LightField` intensity gated to Over). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. In Under/Normal the cyan meter now stays cold regardless of how you climb or what you draw; switch to Over and it wakes — your own glow nearly fills it, a drawn bright stroke completes it. Tunable: the gate is the lambda in `PlayerController` — to allow a faint Under reading instead of nothing, return a small value rather than 0. Geometry/naturalness rework pending the student's choice of direction.)

## Interaction 84 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** R6 finale — light-STEP to the exit replaces the wall-climb (Milestone 21.2)
**Current Goal:** Make R6's draw-to-trip-the-meter beat natural (the vertical wall-climb fought the draw verb).

### Student Prompt
(Follow-up to Interaction 83: chose "horizontal bridge of light" for the R6 rework.)

### Agent Response Summary
Surfaced an engine constraint first: player-drawn strokes are laid at the feet during motion, so they follow the jump arc and can only span ~jump distance before sagging into the void — meaning **any gap a drawn stroke can bridge is also just jumpable**, so a flat horizontal player-drawn bridge over an *un-jumpable* gap is impossible. Confirmed by the existing levels: every player-drawn crossing (R5/R7/R10) is a *step UP*; every wide horizontal bridge (R8) is pre-authored. Presented the engine-true realizations; student chose **"drawn light-step to the exit."**

Reworked R6's finale (`LevelData.cs`, R6_SensorTest) to mirror R5's proven geometry: replaced the vertical ShaftWall + side-meter with a **launch pad → +3 raised exit ledge over a 2-wide gap**, reached by ONE bright step drawn at the jump's apex. The step's `BrightStroke` light wakes the new wall-meter (`R6_LightMeter` at the exit's near lip, LocalLux 0.4) which opens `Door_R6L`. In UNDER a dark step lifts you identically but feeds the meter nothing (reinforced by Interaction 83's Over-gated glow), so it stays cold — the "why not Under?" answers itself. Slid the body-sensor beat left (Floor x78-89→x78-86, shelves/anchor/Door_R6/ceiling shifted ~-1.7) to free the ~2.5 horizontal units the apex-step needs. Soft-lock-proof: `CP_R6b` on the launch pad, a 2-wide exit ledge to redraw a bright stroke from, and a recoverable dark-step path (walk back on the dark step in Under, or redraw in Over from the ledge).

Box/sensor/door/checkpoint/hint counts all unchanged (PostFloor→LaunchPad, ShaftWall→ExitLedge; still 2 DarkPath in R6), so NO validator literal change and the built-object count auto-tracks.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R6_SensorTest finale: launch pad + raised exit ledge + lip-mounted meter, body-sensor shifted left, both hints reworded). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Geometry is a blind edit (editor open → no batchmode/playtest) but mirrors R5's proven pad→+3-ledge-over-2-gap numbers.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Trip the body sensor (climb the dark shelves in Under to the anchor, press 3), pass Door_R6, then on the launch pad in OVER draw a step at the jump's apex up to the raised ledge — the step's light wakes the cyan meter and opens the gate; the same step drawn in Under (dark) lifts you but leaves the meter cold. THINGS TO CHECK IN-ENGINE: (1) the apex-step reaches the +3 ledge over the 2-gap (should feel like R5); (2) the step actually lights the meter at x91.5 (if not, nudge the meter toward the step path or widen its light radius); (3) the drop from the exit ledge into R7 reads OK (3 units). Tunables: ExitLedge height/gap width, R6_LightMeter position, LaunchPad width.)

## Interaction 85 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** OVER becomes a world — blown-out flash exposure, the bright pole opposite Under (Milestone 21.3)
**Current Goal:** Make OVER feel like entering another world (as UNDER does), not a slightly-warmer NORMAL.

### Student Prompt
(很好，但是现在 over 的模式看起来和 normal 真的差别不大，没有 under 那种沉浸式进入另一个世界的感觉)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed the root: OVER's only real differentiator was the camera BACKGROUND (warm-white vs Normal's near-black) — the foreground was nearly untouched. `LightDirector.OverIntensity` was 1.3 ≈ Normal's 1.38, and the PostFX Over grade was a deliberately-subtle split-tone (postExposure 0.10, even darker than Normal's 0.36; filter ~identical to Normal). A prior pass had explicitly chosen "graded overexposure, NOT a light flood" — which is exactly why OVER read like NORMAL. Reframed OVER as the bright pole opposite Under's dark safelight: a cohesive BLOWN-OUT FLASH world.
- **`LightDirector`:** OverIntensity 1.3 → **1.62** (the foreground itself floods now), OverColor → brighter near-white (1.03,0.99,0.92), OverBg → blown near-white (0.94,0.92,0.88).
- **`PostFXDirector` Over grade:** postExposure 0.10 → **0.72** (floods bright), bloom 0.5 → **1.35** + threshold 0.95 → **0.55** (broad halation/glow), saturation -4 → **-32** (bleached toward white), contrast 8 → **3** + vignette 0.20 → **0.05** (shadows lifted/opened — nothing hides, the inverse of Under's deep dark frame), filter → neutral (1.00,1.00,0.99). Split keeps a hint of hot highlights for the "burn" glow.
- **Shutter-flash punch:** committing to OVER (non-silent) fires a bright bloom spike (+0.6 postExposure, +0.8 bloom, threshold → 0.4) that decays over 0.2s into the blown grade — the camera firing. Suppressed on silent ForceSet (respawn / R9 blackout). Cleared in ResetForRestart.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/LightDirector.cs` (Over color/intensity/bg), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (Over grade overhaul + flash-punch field/trigger/Update/reset). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Look is an in-engine judgement.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. Press 3 anywhere with the flash: the screen should now PUNCH bright then settle into a bleached, blown, glowing world with no dark corners — distinct from both warm Normal and dark-cold Under. DIRECTION I CHOSE: blown/bleached/exposed (clinical, "nowhere to hide") with a hot bloom glow for the burn — the most distinct from Normal. IF YOU WANT WARM/BURNING INSTEAD (amber, scorched), it's a few values: PostFX Over filter → warm + stHighlights hotter, OverColor/OverBg warmer. CHECK IN-ENGINE: (1) legibility — can you still read platforms, your bright strokes, and enemies when blown? if too washed, drop PostFX Over.postExposure (0.72) and LightDirector OverIntensity (1.62); (2) is the flash-punch too strong/searing? tune FlashExposure 0.6 / FlashBloom 0.8 / FlashDecay 0.2 in PostFXDirector. All values are named consts/grades.)

## Interaction 86 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** OVER background gets its own hue — hot amber (Milestone 21.4)
**Current Goal:** Give the OVER camera background a distinct colour identity, like UNDER's dark blue.

### Student Prompt
(I want to change the background as well, like the under mode to change the background to dark blue, we could give the over background a new color)

### Agent Response Summary
The three camera backgrounds previously read: Under = deep blue (0.04,0.06,0.14), Normal = near-black (0.07,0.07,0.08), Over = neutral blown near-white (0.94,0.92,0.88) — Over had brightness but no HUE identity. Gave Over a hue: **hot amber-gold (0.96, 0.82, 0.60)** in `LightDirector.OverBg` — the warm pole opposite Under's cool blue (Normal stays the neutral between them), reading as the enlarger's scorch / the burn of commitment. Showed the student a swatch palette (the three modes + three alternative Over hues: hot orange 0.98/0.72/0.42, blown peach 0.99/0.84/0.78, ember 0.93/0.55/0.36) so the colour is theirs to pick — it's a one-value swap.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverBg → hot amber-gold; comment updated to note each mode now owns a hue). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. The Over backdrop is now warm amber behind the bleached/blown foreground — Under blue, Normal near-black, Over amber, a full cool→neutral→warm set. To swap: one line, `OverBg` in `LightDirector` — alternatives offered: hot orange (0.98,0.72,0.42), blown peach (0.99,0.84,0.78), ember/burning (0.93,0.55,0.36). If you want the whole Over light to go warmer to match (not just the backdrop), `OverColor` is the partner value.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 87 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** Over background actually changes — fixed the wrong-layer bug (Milestone 21.5)
**Current Goal:** The student reported (with a screenshot, in OVER) that the Over background looked unchanged.

### Student Prompt
(I don't feel the over's background been changed — screenshot showed OVER selected but a dark world.)

### Agent Response Summary
Two findings. (1) The screenshot's OVER world was DARK — but with the M21.3 changes (postExposure 0.72, OverIntensity 1.62, bloom 1.35) it should be BLOWN BRIGHT. That means a **stale assembly**: Unity was running pre-M21.3 compiled scripts (the editor hadn't reimported the external edits). Flagged the known ⌘R-before-⌘P gotcha. (2) More importantly, the per-mode background I'd been editing was the **wrong layer**: `LightDirector.OverBg` is the camera CLEAR colour, which is (a) hidden behind the parallax backdrop and (b) overwritten every frame by `CameraFollow`'s x-based "develop warm" tint — so it never reaches the screen. The REAL per-mode background is `BackdropTint`, which tints the parallax backdrop sprites (Under's blue comes from `BackdropTint.UnderTint`). Over's was `OverTint = (0.90,0.85,0.74)` — a pale warm-WHITE, too close to the lamp warmth to read as a colour. Fixed: `BackdropTint.OverTint` → saturated **hot amber (0.96,0.76,0.44)**, strength 0.80→0.82 — the true parallel to Under's saturated blue. Added a note on `LightDirector.*Bg` clarifying it's the gap-fallback (BackdropTint owns the visible background).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`World/BackdropTint.cs` (OverTint → hot amber, strength 0.82, comment), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (clarifying note that *Bg is the gap fallback, not the visible background). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(IMPORTANT — ⌘R (Assets → Refresh) BEFORE ⌘P, or Unity keeps running the old assembly and NONE of the recent Over changes show (that's why your screenshot's Over was still dark — the blown-Over grade wasn't compiled in). After recompiling, in OVER you should see BOTH: the foreground blow bright AND the backdrop wash hot amber. The real lever for the per-mode background is `BackdropTint.OverTint`/`OverStrength` (NOT LightDirector.OverBg, which is hidden + overridden by CameraFollow). To push the amber harder, raise OverStrength toward Under's look or saturate OverTint further. If you also want the empty gaps (camera clear colour) to go amber in Over, that needs reconciling CameraFollow's x-based develop tint with exposure — a separate change, flag if wanted.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 88 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** The VOID itself changes per exposure — the real "background" fix (Milestone 21.6)
**Current Goal:** The student noticed the empty background stays black in EVERY mode (Under too), so the per-mode colour was only on the "photo", not the background.

### Student Prompt
(或者是否是改变的就是照片的颜色而不是背景的颜色，因为我发现实际上 under 的背景也是黑的 — "maybe what changes is the photo's colour, not the background's, because I noticed Under's background is also black")

### Agent Response Summary
The student was exactly right. There are two "backgrounds": (1) the backdrop ART ("the photo" — parallax room/props), tinted per exposure by `BackdropTint`; (2) the empty VOID behind it = the camera CLEAR colour. The void was driven by `CameraFollow.LateUpdate` lerping `VisualFactory.Background`→`BackgroundWarm` by player-X ("the print develops warm") — running EVERY frame and overriding `LightDirector`'s per-exposure `*Bg`, so the void stayed near-black in every mode, Under included. So only the photo changed colour, never the background. Fix: **removed CameraFollow's x-based background lerp** (and the now-dead `TintMinX/TintMaxX` fields, `_cam` field/Awake) so `LightDirector` owns the camera clear colour PER EXPOSURE. Set the void colours: Under `(0.05,0.07,0.18)` dark blue, Normal `(0.07,0.07,0.08)` near-black, Over `(0.82,0.56,0.26)` hot amber. Now the WHOLE frame (void + photo) takes the mode's colour — Under a blue world, Over an amber world. Tradeoff flagged: the subtle "develops warm by x" narrative tint is dropped (it was near-imperceptible between two near-blacks and conflicted with per-mode colour); can be re-added inside LightDirector as an exposure-aware warm-by-progress shift if wanted. Updated the [[darkroom-visual-layers]] memory.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/CameraFollow.cs` (removed the x-based bg lerp + dead `TintMinX/TintMaxX`/`_cam`/`Awake`), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (the `*Bg` void colours now actually drive the screen; Under bluer, Over amber). `VisualFactory.BackgroundWarm` now unused (left defined). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(STILL must ⌘R after STOPPING play, then ▶ — Unity won't recompile mid-play. After that: Under = the void goes deep blue (not black anymore), Over = the void goes amber, Normal = near-black. Combined with the foreground flood + BackdropTint, each mode is now a full-screen world. Tunables: `LightDirector.UnderBg/OverBg` (void colours) and `BackdropTint.*Tint` (the photo). If Over's amber void is too bright/dim, OverBg is the single value. If you miss the "develops warm as you progress" tint, say so and I'll re-add it as an exposure-aware shift.)

## Interaction 89 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** OVER edge-merge — halation softens sprite edges on the bright field (Milestone 21.7)
**Current Goal:** In the new bright amber OVER, some elements (esp. the cool grainy latent slabs) show hard sprite edges that don't blend.

### Student Prompt
(good fix. But in over, some elements will be a little strange with the edges not merging well, how to fix?)

### Agent Response Summary
Confirmed the cause: `VisualFactory.GlowMat` (and the ghost/grain sprites) are `Sprite-Unlit-Default` — unlit, alpha-blended, authored to read as light against BLACK. On the bright amber OVER field they sit as pasted-on rectangles (the clearest offenders: the R3 latent FixPlatform slabs' cool tiled grain veil). Fix = HALATION: a real overexposure bleeds the bright field's light around every object, eating hard edges. OVER already had bloom (1.35) but its threshold (0.55) was too high for the bright background to bleed. Lowered `Over.bloomThreshold` 0.55 → **0.42** (the amber field now sits above it and halates) and bumped `Over.bloom` 1.35 → **1.5**. The HUD is a separate overlay canvas (grabbed before post), so it's unaffected.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (Over grade: bloomThreshold 0.42, bloom 1.5, comment). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R after STOPPING play, then ▶. OVER should now read softer/dreamier — the amber bleeds around edges instead of hard sprite boxes. Tunable: `Over.bloomThreshold` (lower = more bleed/haze, higher = crisper) and `Over.bloom`. If the cool grainy LATENT slabs specifically still look pasted-on after this, that's a targeted fix — I'd soften their grain veil (alpha/soft edge in `LevelBuilder.Latent`) or warm its tint so it doesn't fight the amber; say the word. Also possible: fade decorative glow halos in OVER since glows are pointless on a bright field.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 90 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-24
**Development Stage:** OVER reframed — warm golden PRINT instead of white blow-out (Milestone 21.8)
**Current Goal:** The blown/halated OVER clipped surfaces to flat white boxes (worse, not better).

### Student Prompt
(still not good enough — screenshot showed platforms / the light-lift blown to hard flat-white rectangles, lamp beams smearing.)

### Agent Response Summary
The blown direction was the mistake. `postExposure 0.72` + global light `1.62` pushed mid-grey surfaces PAST pure white, so they clipped to flat white boxes, and the low bloom threshold (0.42) smeared the lamps. Key realization: now that the BACKGROUND is amber (the void + BackdropTint), OVER already reads as another world — so the foreground must NOT blow out. Reframed OVER as a warm GOLDEN/SEPIA PRINT that holds its tones:
- `PostFXDirector` Over: postExposure 0.72 → **0.42** (no clipping), bloom 1.5 → **1.0** + threshold 0.42 → **0.62** (only true lights glow, no smear/haze), saturation -32 → **-2** (rich/warm, not bleached white), contrast 3 → **5**, vignette 0.05 → **0.18** warm (frames the print, gives depth), filter → warm golden **(1.06,0.94,0.78)**.
- `LightDirector`: OverIntensity 1.62 → **1.46** (lifted over Normal's 1.38 but not blowing), OverColor → warmer **(1.05,0.96,0.84)**.
The amber background (void + backdrop) is unchanged — it carries the mode identity, so the foreground only needs a warm lift.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (Over grade: golden-print values + comment), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverIntensity 1.46, warmer OverColor). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R after STOPPING play, then ▶. OVER should now be a clean warm GOLDEN world — surfaces hold their tone (no flat-white boxes), lamps glow softly instead of smearing, amber backdrop carries the "other world" feel. The taste axis is DRAMA: if you want it more lifted/intense, raise `Over.postExposure` (0.42) and `OverIntensity` (1.46) a little; if still too bright/washed, drop them. If the amber backdrop ART looks too flat, lower `BackdropTint.OverStrength` (0.82). Tell me which way it's off and I'll dial it.)

## Interaction 91 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** OVER = warm-white (not amber) + midground hangings hidden (Milestone 21.9)
**Current Goal:** Student: revert OVER background from amber to the previous warm-white, and hide the dark midground hangings in OVER for a harmonious frame.

### Student Prompt
(还是有点怪，首先调回之前那个暖白色而非琥珀色，然后在 over 模式下就让中景那些挂件不可见吧，这样和谐一些)

### Agent Response Summary
Two requests, both done.
1. **OVER background amber → warm-white.** `BackdropTint.OverTint` (0.96,0.76,0.44 amber) → **(0.90,0.85,0.74)** (the previous warm-white). `LightDirector.OverBg` void (0.82,0.56,0.26 amber) → **(0.90,0.86,0.78)** soft warm-white. Softened the warm grade so it doesn't drift orange again: PostFX Over `filter` (1.06,0.94,0.78) → **(1.04,0.97,0.88)**, `stHighlights` → gentler (0.55,0.53,0.49), `vignetteColor` less orange; `LightDirector.OverColor` → **(1.04,0.98,0.91)**.
2. **Hide the midground hangings in OVER.** The `MidGround` layer (drying lines, pipes, clutter, safelight) is deliberately untinted dark silhouettes — they read as black blobs on the bright OVER wall. Extended `BackdropTint` to collect the `MidGround` children's sprites and **fade their alpha to 0 in OVER** (lerped, eases with the tint), restored in Under/Normal. No new script/meta — folded into the existing component. (Backdrop is separate from the level root, so no validator impact.)

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`World/BackdropTint.cs` (OverTint warm-white + MidGround fade-out in Over), `Core/LightDirector.cs` (OverBg warm-white void, OverColor gentler), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (Over filter/highlights/vignette softened toward warm-white). No new files; no validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R after STOPPING play, then ▶. OVER is now a soft WARM-WHITE world (not orange), and the midground hangings fade away when you flash to OVER — back when you leave it. Tunables: `BackdropTint.OverTint` + `LightDirector.OverBg` (the warm-white), and the fade is all-or-nothing per the `_midHideT` in `BackdropTint` — if you'd rather DIM them to a faint ghost instead of fully hidden, that's a one-number change (cap `_midHide` below 1).)

## Interaction 92 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Teaching-curve refinement — strict single-solution front, combinatorial back (Milestone 22)
**Current Goal:** Per the professor's advice — early mechanisms force ONE solution (drill each verb), the later half opens to MULTIPLE combination solutions (player expression).

### Student Prompt
(我想再精进一下关卡设计，教授的建议是刚开始的机关只能用一种方式过关，强制用户学习，到后半段再让用户进行多种组合的探索)

### Agent Response Summary
Plan-mode task. Audited all 11 rooms (2 Explore + 2 Plan agents): the FRONT (R0–R6) already forces a single solution per room; the BACK was barely open (only R10 had a real choice). Student chose: open R7–R10 via alternate routes inside the existing 11 rooms (keep R9 pure), AND tighten the front. Implemented:
- **A1 R2** — raised `R2_BurnWall` top 2.5→3.5 (it was un-jumpable by only 0.011u vs the 2.489 apex). Burning stays forced with margin.
- **A2 R3** — repositioned the two latent slabs leftward (`R3_LatentA` 39.8→**36.2**, `R3_LatentB` 41.2→**39.0**) so printing slab A ALONE leaves R4 un-jumpable (A right edge x37.0, 5.0u gap > 4.54u reach), forcing B as a mandatory SECOND print. Closes the one front-half looseness (the skippable second print). Updated comments.
- **B1 R7** — added `FixDef("R7_LatentLedge", 104.2, 5.6, 1.6, 0.4)`: a PRINT route to the high ledge as an alternate to freeze+draw (drawer-vs-printer; pairs with freezing the guard first). Ghost until printed, so a verb is still mandatory.
- **B2 R8** — added `FixDef("R8_LatentStep", 111.5, 6.6, 1.6, 0.4)` on the light-bridge (OVER) side only — a printer's handhold (modest; the dark bridge is UNDER-only so can't be printed on). Doesn't bypass the switch rule.
- **B3a R10** — reworded the umbra hint to sanction a second verb (draw a bright stroke across the curtain vs flood-in-Over). No object.
- **B3b R10 exit rung — DROPPED**: verified AnchorB→ExitPlatform is already a trivial jump after the final burn, so a rung there is redundant.
- **Validator**: bumped `fixPlats == 3` → **5** (R3 x2 + R7/R8/R10 x1). No other count changed (no boxes/enemies/sensors/doors/burns/hints/lostFrames added).

Result: front half is now strictly single-solution (R3's two-print rule enforced, R2 hardened); back third (R7/R10 strongly, R8 modestly) offers genuine multi-verb choice — the "single front, combinatorial back" arc.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R2 resize, R3 reposition, R7+R8 new FixDefs, R10 hint), `Editor/DarkroomValidator.cs` (`fixPlats` 3→5). No new files; no new metas.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). Batchmode validator deferred (Editor open) — only the `fixPlats` literal changed and it matches the authored count.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P, and run the batchmode validator when the Editor is closed. IN-ENGINE CHECKS — the geometry margins are tight: R3 (print ONE slab → R4 should now be un-jumpable, forcing the 2nd print; print-from-floor ~2.2–3.0u distances); R7 (solvable BOTH by freeze+draw AND by printing the new slab — confirm the ~2.2u print-from-floor and the slab→ledge +1.7 hop); R8 (the new rung prints from Start but the anchor-switch rule still holds); R10 (umbra now passable by a drawn bright stroke too). If any print distance is just out of range or a margin reads wrong, the slab coords are single-number nudges.)

## Interaction 93 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Layered 2.5D depth — new parallax bands + rigged silhouette figures (Milestone 22)
**Current Goal:** The student asked to make the visuals richer — add assets (incl. rigged characters) and more varied foreground / mid-ground / background arrangements for a 3D-like effect.

### Student Prompt
(Can we add any additional assets — such as rigged characters — to make the visuals richer? I'd like more varied arrangements of foreground, mid-ground, and background elements to give the 2D visuals a more 3D-like effect.)

### Agent Response Summary
Planned in plan-mode (4 Explore agents + the art bibles). Found the depth system was real but under-used: only 2 art bands (far scenes 0.15/-22, hanging clutter 0.40/-10) + world lamps, and `ART_DIRECTION.md` already SPEC'd a Foreground (~1.3/60) and Backdrop-near (~0.30/-14) band that were never built. The "rigged character" precedent already existed (`ScriptedBlackout.BuildShades` multi-part figure + `SilhouetteArt` rasterizer). Asked 3 questions; student chose: all four scope pieces, a real Unity 2D-bone (SpriteSkin) rig, and sparse/on-theme figures. Implemented as non-colliding scenery under the persistent `_Backdrop` (gameplay byte-for-byte untouched):
1. **Two new parallax bands** in `BackdropBuilder`: `BuildNear` (`Layer_Near`, factor 0.30, sort -14, art `bn_*.png` else far-scenes reused smaller) — tinted like the backdrop; `BuildForeground` (`Foreground`, factor 1.25 + vert-follow 0.92, sort 60 > player, art `fg_*.png` else thin code silhouettes: drooping cables / enlarger arm / print edge) — sparse + edge-biased so footing is never ambiguous (Closure/Contrast rule). Five distinct band speeds (0.15/0.30/0.40/1.25 + world) is the 3D cue.
2. **Sparse silhouette figures** (`BackdropFigures` + `RigActor` + `CharacterRig`): 3 deep figures (a swaying worker @x20, seated watchers @x68/@x112) — NONE in the prologue ("she walks alone") or the R9 corridor (already has 3 shades). Each tries `Resources.Load<GameObject>("Characters/<Kind>")` (an authored SpriteSkin rig prefab); if absent → a code puppet (a `SilhouetteArt` body + a shoulder-jointed swinging arm) animated by `RigActor` (arm swing + body bob, à la `PlayerAnimator`/`ScriptedBlackout`). Faceless per the art bible; only the watcher gets a faint WHITE eye-glint (GlowMat, never red).
3. **`BackdropTint` generalized**: the MidGround Over-fade now covers a `FadeRoots = {MidGround, Foreground, Figures}` set, so all constant-dark bands fade out in the bright Over world (they'd read as black blobs). Alpha is owned solely by BackdropTint, so `RigActor` stays transform-only and the two never fight.
4. **Drop-in AI-PNG pipeline**: `PixelArt` got `BackdropNear`/`ForegroundCutouts`/`FigureCutouts` auto-discovery loaders (`bn_*`/`fg_*`/`char_*`, mirroring `bd_*`/`mid_*`, via a shared `GlobArt` helper); `process_aigen.py` got `bn_`/`fg_`/`char_` branches; added `FOREGROUND_PROMPTS.md` + `CHARACTER_PROMPTS.md`. `VisualFactory` got `OrderNear/-14`, `OrderFigure/-8`, `OrderForeground/60`. SpriteSkin authoring (bones+weights in the Skinning Editor → prefab in `Resources/Characters/`) is the one in-editor step; the code puppet shows until then.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW: `Core/CharacterRig.cs`, `World/RigActor.cs`, `World/BackdropFigures.cs` (+ hand-made `.meta`s, Editor open), `art-pipeline/FOREGROUND_PROMPTS.md`, `art-pipeline/CHARACTER_PROMPTS.md`. MODIFIED: `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (BuildNear/BuildForeground + helpers, wired into Build), `World/BackdropTint.cs` (FadeRoots), `Core/PixelArt.cs` (3 globbed loaders + GlobArt), `Core/SilhouetteArt.cs` (pivot-capable ToSprite + Worker/Watcher/Arm figures), `Core/VisualFactory.cs` (3 sort constants), `art-pipeline/process_aigen.py` (bn_/fg_/char_ branches). No collider/LevelData/validator change (backdrop is separate from the level root; validator doesn't inspect it).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`); `process_aigen.py` parses clean. Batchmode validator deferred (Editor open) — no level-root change so counts/seams are unaffected.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R BEFORE ⌘P. You should now see depth: far scenes, a nearer scene band, hanging clutter, the lamps, and an out-of-focus foreground all scrolling at different speeds; 3 distant silhouette figures (a worker's arm working, two seated watchers) deep behind the play space, white eyes only, that FADE OUT in Over. Tunables: figure placement/scale/parallax in `BackdropFigures.Figures`; foreground density in `BuildForeground`'s step; near-band scale/parallax in `BuildNear`. To add the REAL SpriteSkin rig: follow the note at the bottom of `CHARACTER_PROMPTS.md` — author a bone rig and save it as `Resources/Characters/Worker.prefab`/`Watcher.prefab` and `RigActor` swaps the puppet for it automatically. To drop in AI art: `bn_*`/`fg_*`/`char_*.png` into `StreamingAssets/art/`, run `process_aigen.py`, ⌘R. If the foreground ever hides footing, lower its alpha or widen the step; if figures feel too present, cut `BackdropFigures.Figures` to one or two.)

## Interaction 94 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Figure sprites created + cutout tier wired (Milestone 22.1)
**Current Goal:** Student: "help me find or create a figure sprite" (for the M22 figure system).

### Student Prompt
(help me find or create a figure sprite)

### Agent Response Summary
Created the sprites procedurally (PIL, in the art-pipeline) rather than sourcing external art, to honor the locked silhouette aesthetic. First found+fixed a gap from M22: the `char_*.png` loader existed in `PixelArt` but nothing consumed it — `BackdropFigures` only used the Resources rig prefab or the code puppet. Replaced `PixelArt.FigureCutouts` (glob list) with `PixelArt.FigureCutout(kind, ppu)` (single `art/char_<kind>.png`, bottom-pivot, cached incl. null) and added a CUTOUT TIER to `BackdropFigures.BuildOne`: **rig prefab > char_<kind>.png cutout > code puppet**. `BuildCutout` scales the cutout to the puppet's world height (bottom-pivot keeps feet on the line) and gently bobs it (the arm is part of the cutout, so no separate swing).

New generator `art-pipeline/gen_figures.py`: draws clean cut-paper silhouettes from tapered capsules + discs, supersampled→LANCZOS-downsampled for AA, with a cool LEFT rim (matches `SilhouetteArt.Body 0x0A0A0C` / `Rim 0x2A2A30`), autocropped with feet at the bottom row, facing right. Outputs `char_worker.png` (stooped worker, flat cap, near arm bent forward over a bench) and `char_watcher.png` (hunched seated figure, head bowed over drawn-up knees). Saved straight into `StreamingAssets/art/` (already near-black + transparent → do NOT run process_aigen on them). Iterated once on a preview (`_preview_figures.png`): widened/bent the worker's working arm; rebuilt the watcher from a 3-disc "snowman" into a readable hunched seated form. These are also the import source for the optional SpriteSkin rig (limbs drawn with gaps for clean auto-geometry/auto-weights).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW: `art-pipeline/gen_figures.py`, `Assets/StreamingAssets/art/char_worker.png` + `char_watcher.png` (+ DefaultImporter `.meta`s, Editor open). MODIFIED: `Core/PixelArt.cs` (`FigureCutout(kind,ppu)` replaces the glob), `World/BackdropFigures.cs` (cutout tier + `BuildCutout`). No collider/validator change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`); generator runs (worker 267×851, watcher 333×432); preview verified visually.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P — the worker now stands at x≈20 and the watchers at x≈68/112, using the new PNGs (the code puppet only shows if a PNG is missing). To re-tune the look, edit the coords in `gen_figures.py` and re-run `python3 art-pipeline/gen_figures.py`. To go further: drop your own `char_worker.png`/`char_watcher.png` (any source — AI via CHARACTER_PROMPTS.md, or CC0) in `StreamingAssets/art/`, or build the full SpriteSkin rig from these and save it as `Resources/Characters/Worker.prefab`. Want a third pose (e.g. a standing figure facing away) or different placement? Say the word.)

## Interaction 95 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Edit-mode scene preview baker — see & drag elements without Play (Milestone 22.2)
**Current Goal:** Student: 可否将场景永久生成,而不是每次按 Play 才有,方便手动调整各个元素位置 — wanted to position elements (incl. exposure-gated / "develops-solid" platforms) in the editor.

### Student Prompt
(可否将场景永久生成,而不是每次我按 play 才有,这样方便我手动调整各个元素的位置)

### Agent Response Summary
Confirmed feasibility (the validator already runs `LevelBuilder.Build` in edit mode; `LightDirector.CreatePoint` is a pure static; ParallaxLayer/BackdropTint/Drift only act in Play). Flagged the real catch: the art is **runtime-generated in-memory textures**, so a plain "save into the scene" loses every sprite ref on recompile/reopen. Asked approach + scope; student chose **edit-mode rebuildable preview** over asset-baking, scope = **full scene incl. the Under/Over-gated and latent (flash-to-develop) platforms**.

Built `Editor/DarkroomSceneBaker.cs` ([InitializeOnLoad]) with menu items under **Darkroom/**:
- **Build Scene In Editor** — clears any prior preview, runs `BackdropBuilder.Build()` + `LevelBuilder.Build(Bootstrap.BuildThroughRoomCount)` in edit mode, tags roots, and **force-shows the gated/latent platforms** (in edit mode `ExposureObject.OnEnable` applies NORMAL → DarkPath α0, and `FixPlatform.Awake` sets α0.16, so they'd be invisible; `ForceVisible` lifts every `ExposureObject`/`FixPlatform` renderer to α0.85). Selects `_Backdrop`.
- **Clear Generated Scene** — destroys everything tagged with the new `World/DarkroomPreviewMarker`.
- **Log Element Positions** — prints figures as **paste-ready `Spec(...)` lines** for `BackdropFigures.Figures[]` (reads localPosition + ParallaxLayer.Factor + Visual scale/flip) and the current selection as name/world-pos/scale; also writes `art-pipeline/_layout_dump.txt`. This is the path to make a tuned position permanent at runtime (drag → Log → fold values into the builders/data).

Safety: preview roots are `HideFlags.DontSave` (never serialised, dropped on domain reload — it's a *rebuildable* preview, not a saved scene), and entering Play auto-clears the preview via `playModeStateChanged(ExitingEditMode)` so Bootstrap's runtime build never doubles the scene. No Bootstrap/runtime-builder edits needed (the existing `_Backdrop` Find-guard + the new clear-on-play cover it).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW: `Editor/DarkroomSceneBaker.cs`, `World/DarkroomPreviewMarker.cs` (+ metas). No changes to existing builders, Bootstrap, colliders, or LevelData. Offline compile harness extended to cover Editor scripts (UnityEditor.CoreModule.dll module-form ref; fixed Unity-6.4 `FindObjectsByType(FindObjectsSortMode)` deprecation → `FindObjectsByType(FindObjectsInactive.Include)`).

### Immediate Result
Offline compile clean BOTH tiers: `RUNTIME COMPILE OK` and `EDITOR COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(In Unity: menu **Darkroom ▸ Build Scene In Editor** — the whole world appears in the Scene view WITHOUT pressing Play, with the Under/Over-only and flash-to-develop platforms forced visible so you can position them. Drag anything. To make positions stick: select what you moved (or just the figures) → **Darkroom ▸ Log Element Positions** → it prints ready-to-paste values (and writes art-pipeline/_layout_dump.txt); send them to me or paste figure Spec lines into BackdropFigures. **Darkroom ▸ Clear Generated Scene** removes it. Note: it's a *rebuildable preview* — it auto-clears on Play and on script recompile (the art is generated in memory), so just rebuild. If instead you want a TRULY permanent saved scene, say so and I'll add the heavier asset-baking path (saves the generated sprites as real assets).)

## Interaction 96 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** First round-trip: editor-tuned platform positions baked into data (Milestone 22.3)
**Current Goal:** Student used the M22.2 edit-mode preview to drag two latent platforms and wanted the new positions made permanent.

### Student Prompt
(我 log 了 / 我应该改了两个平台,人物没改 / 另外一个也好了 — logged element positions after dragging two platforms in the editor preview.)

### Agent Response Summary
Closed the preview→data loop. Read `art-pipeline/_layout_dump.txt` across two captures (selection-based): `R8_LatentStep` (112.4, 8.2) and `R7_LatentLedge` (102.9, 5.3). Confirmed both differ from the authored `FixDef` values, so the student really moved them. Baked both into `LevelData.fixPlats`: R7 104.2,5.6 → 102.9,5.3; R8 111.5,6.6 → 112.4,8.2 (updated the x-range/top comments too). fixPlats count stays 5 (validator unaffected). FLAGGED the gameplay risk: these are load-bearing print-to-develop footings with tight margins — R7's slab→ledge(7.5) hop grows 1.7→2.0 (slab dropped to top 5.5) and shifts the print-from-floor distance; R8 (optional rung) rose 1.6, which can put it out of step/print range. Asked the student to playtest R7/R8 solvability; offered single-number revert/nudge.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R7_LatentLedge + R8_LatentStep FixDef coords + comments). No other change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R then ⌘P. R7/R8 latent slabs now sit where you dragged them. PLEASE verify both are still solvable — R7's slab→ledge jump is now +2.0 (may be too high) and the print-from-floor distance changed; R8 rose 1.6 (may be out of print/step range). If either breaks, it's a single-number fix or a revert. Reminder: dragging in the editor preview is a *view* — these took effect at runtime only because the values were baked here into LevelData.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 97 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Bugfix — edit-mode preview leaking into Play (Milestone 22.4)
**Current Goal:** Student hit bugs after using the preview: bridges visible outside Under, and burned walls still blocking.

### Student Prompt
(出 bug 了,有些地方不 under 也有桥,然后墙烧了也过不去)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed as the M22.2 edit-mode preview LEAKING into Play (a duplicated level). The preview's `ForceVisible` lifts every ExposureObject (incl. DarkPath bridges) to α0.85 and the copies aren't exposure-synced → "bridges show outside Under"; preview BurnPaper walls keep their collider (inert in edit mode, never burn) → a ghost wall overlaps the real one so "burned walls still block". The auto-clear on `playModeStateChanged(ExitingEditMode)` evidently didn't cover the student's setup (likely Domain Reload off, or Play entered with a preview present). Durable fix: `Bootstrap.Boot` now destroys any `DarkroomPreviewMarker` roots (DestroyImmediate, before building) so the runtime scene is never doubled regardless of domain-reload settings — no-op in real builds. Immediate user steps: Darkroom ▸ Clear Generated Scene → ⌘R → ⌘P. Not a regression from the R7/R8 coord bakes (those don't touch bridges/burn walls).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/Bootstrap.cs` (boot-time preview-marker cleanup before the build). No other change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(Order matters: Clear Generated Scene, then ⌘R (so the new Bootstrap assembly loads — stale-assembly gotcha), then ⌘P. Under-only bridges and burnable walls should behave again. If a bug REMAINS after a clean ⌘R+⌘P with NO preview built, it's not the preview — tell me and I'll look at the actual bridge/burn objects. General rule now reinforced: the editor preview is a view-only scratchpad; never play with it present (Bootstrap now self-heals, but Clear first is the habit).)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 98 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Bugfix (root cause) — leftover build roots in the open scene leaked into Play (Milestone 22.5)
**Current Goal:** Student: bridges visible outside Under, burned walls still block, AND all fore/mid/back scenery gone — Clear didn't help.

### Student Prompt
(还是不正常,我之前就是 clear 过了的...现在前中后景的东西也都没了,一起查查 → screenshots: no _Backdrop in Hierarchy, Console clean → confirmed fixed.)

### Agent Response Summary
Checked the scene files (Level01/SampleScene clean — student was actually in an unsaved "Untitled" scene). Added temporary `[Boot]`/`[BackdropBuilder]` Debug.Logs; the student's Console proved it: `previews cleared=0; _Backdrop pre-existing=6 children` → `[BackdropBuilder] SKIPPED — _Backdrop already exists`. ROOT CAUSE: a baker-built `_Backdrop` (+ `_Level`) was left in the open edit scene and its `DarkroomPreviewMarker` was lost across recompiles (so the marker-based Clear/boot-cleanup missed it). At Play it made `BackdropBuilder.Build` hit its `GameObject.Find("_Backdrop")` guard and SKIP (stale zombie backdrop → "scenery gone"), while `LevelBuilder.Build` (no guard) built a SECOND `_Level` over the stale one → duplicate level → ghost bridges (forced-visible, not exposure-synced) + duplicate burn walls (burn the real one, the ghost still blocks). One root cause, all three symptoms. `DontDestroyOnLoad` is used nowhere in our code (the Hierarchy's `DontDestroyOnLoad/[Debug Updater]` is Unity's own).

FIX: `Bootstrap.Boot` now destroys any pre-existing `_Backdrop`/`_Level`/`_HUD` (by marker AND by name) before building, so Play always builds fresh regardless of editor leftovers (no-op in real builds). `DarkroomSceneBaker.Clear` also clears the build roots by name now (so a marker-lost leftover is still wiped by Darkroom ▸ Clear Generated Scene). Student confirmed fixed; removed the temp diagnostics afterward.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/Bootstrap.cs` (boot-time destroy of leftover `_Backdrop`/`_Level`/`_HUD` by marker+name), `Editor/DarkroomSceneBaker.cs` (`Clear` now also removes build roots by name; `BuildRoots` list). Reverted the temporary `[Boot]`/`[BackdropBuilder]` logs.

### Immediate Result
Student confirmed in-engine: scenery back, Under-only bridges, burnable walls. Offline `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(好嘞,修好了. Habit going forward: work in Assets/Scenes/Level01, not an Untitled scene; the editor preview is view-only — Darkroom ▸ Clear Generated Scene (now name-based) before saving/closing, though Boot now self-heals at Play regardless.)

## Interaction 99 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Direction — lifting the "code-only / zero-asset" constraint; glow-up vision (Milestone 23, planning)
**Current Goal:** Student wants to abandon the self-imposed "build only from code / no external assets" rules and boldly imagine how to make the game more beautiful.

### Student Prompt
(然后我觉得可以抛弃"只使用代码构建"和"不用外部素材"这种陈旧规矩,大胆设想怎么能让游戏更加精美)

### Agent Response Summary
Reframed: the constraint to drop is the ENGINEERING rule (code-only/zero-asset); the SOUL to keep is STORY_CONCEPT's locked aesthetic (chiaroscuro, faceless silhouettes, single concealed light, reserved red, photographic develop). Ran a 6-lens ideation workflow (shaders/postfx, lighting/materials, depth/atmosphere/vfx, characters/animation, audio, ui/cinematics) — each read ART_DIRECTION.md + STORY_CONCEPT.md + the relevant code and returned on-theme upgrades with impact/effort/risk (40 ideas). Synthesized into tiers:
- SIGNATURE (share one new URP Full-Screen Pass Renderer Feature): (1) Sabattier solarization on every exposure switch (the core verb becomes chemistry, §2), (2) authored emulsion grain + red-biased CineStill halation (retire URP FilmGrain), (3) diegetic film-gate border + sprockets + film-advance room transition synced to the ratchet, (4) bone-rig the girl + shades (SpriteSkin already installed; CharacterRig.Load entry already stubbed), shade-wake = red-halation jointed lurch.
- DEPTH/LIGHT: normal maps + ShadowCaster2D (shadow-as-platform literal), light cookies (window gobo / enlarger cone), god-ray shafts, chemical vapor + tray caustics, commit develop-bloom particles.
- NARRATIVE IMAGE: 11th frame truly blank → exponential develop, eyes last, Rembrandt gold (small change, big payoff); real contact-sheet win screen w/ grease-pencil marks (TMP); Timeline+Cinemachine prologue/finale (both packages installed, unused).
- AUDIO: FMOD adaptive backbone (exposure = one global param → snapshots) OR code AudioMixer snapshot fallback; developing leitmotif across 11 frames; Basinski decay arc; OVER-gated shade threat layer; recorded foley + shutter/ratchet signature.
Recommended first slice: signature 1+2+3 (shared render-feature infra, hits the highest-frequency verb, no heavy art production), rig (4) in parallel. Guardrails reiterated: red stays reserved (halation red only on true over-exposure/threat), gameplay plane stays razor-sharp (Closure/Contrast), keep systemic things procedural — authored assets only for one-off beauty. Asked the student which thread to turn into a formal plan.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
None (ideation/direction only). Workflow output archived in the run transcript.

### Immediate Result
Vision blueprint delivered; awaiting the student's chosen first thread before implementation.

### Student Follow-up
(Pending: pick a thread — full-screen render feature (Sabattier + grain/halation) vs the lighter film-gate border/transition vs the character bone-rig — and I'll write it up as a concrete plan.)

## Interaction 100 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Glow-up program kickoff — W1 film gate shipped, rig track handed off (Milestone 23.1)
**Current Goal:** Student approved implementing ALL the glow-up ideas ("全部实施"), and said tell them what to do manually for the real skeletal rig.

### Student Prompt
(所有建议都很好,全部实施,上真骨骼如果需要我操作就告诉我)

### Agent Response Summary
Framed the program as 6 waves tracked as tasks (W1 film-gate, W2 fullscreen render-feature: Sabattier + grain/halation, W3 character bone rigs, W4 lighting/materials, W5 narrative-image/cinematics, W6 audio adaptive backbone). Code-side I do + compile-verify each wave; the manual/content steps (rigging, FMOD choice, recording foley, painting backdrops, attaching the URP Renderer Feature) get handed to the student as checklists to run in parallel.

Shipped W1 — the diegetic FILM GATE (UI top pick, low-risk, reframes the whole game): `PixelArt.SprocketCell` (a near-void film-base cell with a soft rounded perforation) + `HUDController.BuildFilmGate()` — two 26px film-base margins down the screen edges with stacked 35mm sprockets, and an engraved Mono edge-code in the bottom margin that counts the roll (prologue = "—", frames = "01A".."10A"), wired into the existing per-room block. Built early (low sibling index) so it sits behind the readable HUD; monochrome, introduces no red (can't break the red rule); thin + low-value so it never occludes footing (§5 "film-base border the camera never crosses").

Handed off the W3 rigging steps (Skinning Editor on char_worker.png → bones → auto-weights → prefab w/ Animator → Resources/Characters/Worker.prefab; RigActor.SetRigged already routes motion to the prefab Animator, CharacterRig.Load already wired). Noted the player-girl rig needs a girl source sprite I'll generate next.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (SprocketCell), `UI/HUDController.cs` (_edgeCode field, BuildFilmGate(), per-room edge-code). No gameplay change.

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`). W1 task complete (pending in-engine visual tune).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: the screen edges now carry film sprockets + a frame edge-code; tunables = margin width / cell size / spacing in BuildFilmGate, sprocket tone in PixelArt.SprocketCell. Next code wave W2 = the fullscreen Sabattier+grain/halation render feature (URP17 RenderGraph; needs a one-time manual "add Renderer Feature to the URP Renderer asset" + in-engine iteration). Parallel: student starts the W3 rig in the Skinning Editor.)

## Interaction 101 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W1 reworked to transient gate + checkpoint redesign (Milestone 23.2)
**Current Goal:** Student: make the film gate appear only transiently at each checkpoint (frame advance), redesign the checkpoint visual, and then do all remaining waves in one push.

### Student Prompt
(W1 的片门可以只在每个存档点,也就是进入下一关时渐显,然后消失,同时也把存档点那个东西也设计的好一点。然后剩下的都一鼓作气做了)

### Agent Response Summary
Reworked W1: the film gate is no longer a permanent border. Wrapped it in a CanvasGroup (`_gateGroup`, alpha 0) and added `HUDController.RevealFilmGate()` → fade in 0.4s / hold 1.6s / fade out 0.9s — the film "advancing through the gate" at each checkpoint. Triggered from `Checkpoint.OnTriggerEnter2D` (first touch only).

Redesigned the checkpoint from the crude 8px `CheckpointMarker` into a print pinned on the drying line: `LevelBuilder.CheckpointAt` now composes cord + clothespin + a `PixelArt.PrintFrame` (paper border + photo window, Polaroid bottom margin) + a soft glow (off). It hangs as a COOL undeveloped negative; on arrival `Checkpoint.Develop()` warms it to a finished print, raises the glow to 0.5, snaps the clip (sin punch), bursts a warm StrokeSparkle, and plays PlayFilmAdvance (ratchet) + PlayDevelop. Part refs injected by the builder (Frame/Glow/Clip), all null-guarded; develop/capture/gate fire once via `_developed`, but the respawn point still refreshes on re-touch.

Set expectation for "do it all": proceeding through W2–W6 autonomously (not pausing per wave); code I do + compile-verify, content/manual steps (rigging, FMOD choice, recorded foley, painted art, attaching the URP Renderer Feature) batched as checklists.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (PrintFrame sprite), `UI/HUDController.cs` (gate CanvasGroup + RevealFilmGate/FilmGateRoutine), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (CheckpointAt redesign w/ injected part refs), `World/Checkpoint.cs` (Develop coroutine + gate trigger). Old `PixelArt.CheckpointMarker` now unused (left in place).

### Immediate Result
Offline Tier-1 `csc` clean (`COMPILE OK`, `-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: reach a checkpoint — the hanging print develops cool→warm with a clip-snap, glow and ratchet, and the sprocket gate winds in then away. Tunables: FilmGateRoutine timings, Checkpoint.Develop dur/colors, CheckpointAt part positions, PrintFrame art. Continuing to W2 (fullscreen Sabattier+grain/halation render feature — will need a one-time "attach Renderer Feature to URP Renderer asset" + in-engine tuning) and W3 rig is the student's parallel manual track.)

## Interaction 102 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Checkpoint print resized + W2 fullscreen photographic pass (Milestone 23.3)
**Current Goal:** Student (with screenshot): the checkpoint print is too narrow — make it smaller + more square — then continue with W2.

### Student Prompt
(W1 存档点这个相纸感觉太窄了,可以稍小一点然后偏正方形一点。然后接着做剩下的 W2 等)

### Agent Response Summary
Print fix: `PixelArt.PrintFrame` 40x52→**44x46 (near-square), ppu 64→80 (smaller)**, photo window re-inset for a Polaroid bottom margin; `CheckpointAt` part offsets retuned (cord y1.2/h0.6, clip y0.86, glow 1.05²).

W2 (Renderer-Feature route, per the student's choice) shipped as code: `Assets/Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (fullscreen URP Blit shader — Sabattier solarization fold + Mackie edge on exposure-switch, 8-tap red-biased halation, shadow-weighted animated grain; all gated by global floats), `Core/DarkroomPostFeature.cs` (ScriptableRendererFeature + URP17 **RenderGraph** pass: AddBlitPass src→dest, requiresIntermediateTexture, swaps resourceData.cameraColor; shader found by name so no material asset to wire; no-ops if shader missing), `Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (sets `_DR_Solar` pulse on each switch + `_DR_Grain/_DR_Halation/_DR_HalRed` lerped per exposure — halation reddens ONLY in Over, honoring the reserved-red rule), wired into Bootstrap managers. Audio chosen earlier = pure-code AudioMixer (W6, later). W2 needs ONE manual step: add the feature to `Assets/Settings/Renderer2D.asset`, then in-engine param tuning.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (PrintFrame), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (checkpoint part offsets), NEW `Resources/DarkroomPost.shader`, `Core/DarkroomPostFeature.cs`, `Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (+ metas), `Core/Bootstrap.cs` (+DarkroomPostDriver).

### Immediate Result
Offline clean: feature-only compiled against URP runtime+core (`FEATURE OK`, validating the RenderGraph API), then full runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(Manual step for W2: ⌘R → select Assets/Settings/Renderer2D.asset → Add Renderer Feature → "Darkroom Post Feature" (leave the Shader field empty; it auto-finds Darkroom/Post) → ⌘P. Expect: a solarization flick on each exposure switch, constant fine grain, halation that reddens in Over. We then tune DarkroomPostDriver amounts + shader constants in-engine. Continuing to W4/W5 code next; W3 rig remains the student's parallel track.)

## Interaction 103 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W2 bugfix — black screen on the 2D renderer; pivot to built-in Full Screen Pass (Milestone 23.3a)
**Current Goal:** Student added the custom DarkroomPostFeature to Renderer2D and the whole screen went black (audio + control still worked).

### Student Prompt
(我加上了,但是画面全黑,有声音也能操控)

### Agent Response Summary
Diagnosed: the game still runs (audio/input), so the custom RenderGraph fullscreen pass output black. Root cause: the project uses the URP **2D Renderer**, where a custom ScriptableRendererFeature that swaps `resourceData.cameraColor` is unreliable (the final present can end up showing the unwritten/culled destination — black). The docs blit example targets the 3D Universal Renderer. Pivoted to Unity's **built-in Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature**, which officially supports the 2D renderer and composes correctly. Deleted `Core/DarkroomPostFeature.cs` (+meta); kept `Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` and `Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs`. Also corrected the shader sampling to the X-macro (`SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D_X(_BlitTexture, ...)`) — the correct contract for `_BlitTexture` (and for the built-in feature). The shader's structure (Blit.hlsl Vert + Frag(Varyings):SV_Target sampling `_BlitTexture`) matches the built-in feature's expectations.

New manual path: ⌘R → remove the now-missing "Darkroom Post Feature" slot → create a Material from Darkroom/Post → add the built-in "Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature" with that material (Injection = After Rendering Post Processing, Requirements = Color). DarkroomPostDriver still drives the globals.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
DELETED `Core/DarkroomPostFeature.cs` (+meta). `Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D → _X). Kept driver + Bootstrap wiring.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(Safety: removing/disabling the feature always returns the screen to normal — you're never stuck black. Steps: ⌘R; on Renderer2D remove the missing custom feature; right-click DarkroomPost.shader → Create → Material; Add Renderer Feature → Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature → Pass Material = that material, Injection = After Rendering Post Processing, Requirements = Color; ⌘P. If still black with the BUILT-IN feature, that's an injection/requirements issue — try Before Rendering Post Processing, or report and I'll switch to a culling-disabled RasterRenderPass.)

## Interaction 104 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W2 flash toned down · W5 11th-frame develop · W4 vapor atmosphere (Milestone 23.4)
**Current Goal:** Student: the solarization flash on exposure switch is too bright — tone it down — then continue W4, W5.

### Student Prompt
(好嘞,切曝光时一道显影闪太亮了调一调,然后继续 W4,W5)

### Agent Response Summary
W2 flash toned down: `DarkroomPostDriver` solar pulse peak 1.0→**0.5** and decay 0.35s→**0.28s**; shader fold 0.85→0.7 and Mackie-edge add 0.6→**0.3**. (Built-in Full Screen Pass route from 103 confirmed working.)

W5 — the 11th-frame finale reworked in `WinScreen` to the brief: removed the pre-ghost `SelfPortraitLatent` so the paper reads genuinely BLANK; the self-portrait now AMPLIFIES out of nothing (alpha = pow(t,1.9), exponential silver-halide curve) over 2.2s, cold→warm; the figure develops FACELESS (`SilhouetteArt.PlayerBlank`), and the glowing EYE — the punctum — is a separate glint+halo (PixelArt.Disc + SoftGlow) placed at the eye, revealed LAST (final 20%) with a soft develop click. (Barthes "eyes surface last", Rembrandt warm paper.)

W4 — first atmosphere pass: new `World/VaporMotes.cs` — faint cool chemical-vapor wisps (SoftGlow, α0.025–0.06) drifting slowly UPWARD, camera-tracked + wrapping like DustMotes; added to the camera in `Bootstrap.SetupCamera`. Purely cosmetic.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (solar peak/decay), `Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (fold/Mackie down), `UI/WinScreen.cs` (blank→exponential develop, faceless body + eye-last glint), NEW `World/VaporMotes.cs` (+meta), `Core/Bootstrap.cs` (+VaporMotes on camera).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P. Flash is now a restrained flick (tunables: DarkroomPostDriver `_solar` peak + decay, shader fold/Mackie consts). Faint vapor haze rises across the view immediately. The 11th-frame finale shows on WIN: blank paper → exponential develop → eye ignites last. Next: more W4 (god-ray shafts + ShadowCaster2D need in-engine tuning), W6 audio (code AudioMixer snapshots), and the W5 contact-sheet grease-pencil marks. W3 rig stays the student's parallel track.)

## Interaction 105 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W2/W4/W5 polish — kill the flash, make grain+vapor visible, declutter the win UI (Milestone 23.5)
**Current Goal:** Student (win-screen screenshot): exposure switch should be a colour transition only (no flash); vapor + emulsion grain aren't visible; the final win-screen UI overlaps/looks messy.

### Student Prompt
(显影调成颜色的过渡就行,不要闪了。蒸汽在哪里有,好像看不到啊,自研乳剂颗粒好像也看不到。然后最后一关 UI 有点混乱,先把这些修了)

### Agent Response Summary
1. NO FLASH: `DarkroomPostDriver.OnExposure` no longer pulses `_solar` (stays 0) — the exposure change rides PostFXDirector's colour grade alone; the shader's solarization branch is now inert. Kept grain+halation.
2. GRAIN VISIBLE: bumped `_grainT` to Under 0.18 / Normal 0.15 / Over 0.10 (was 0.09/0.06/0.05) and changed the shader grain coord to per-pixel + properly animated (`uv * _BlitTexture_TexelSize.zw + _DR_Time * 91.7`, was `*0.5 + _DR_Time` — too fine + nearly static).
3. VAPOR VISIBLE: `VaporMotes` alpha 0.025–0.06 → 0.12–0.22, count 9→11.
4. WIN UI DECLUTTER: re-spaced WinScreen with clear gaps — margins -120/-150 (was -104/-140), LostCoda -188, DEVELOPED block 34→28pt at y-270 (was -256), TIME y-360, EXIF caption y112 (was 130, was colliding with TIME and the contact strip). No more overlaps among margins / LostCoda / DEVELOPED / TIME / EXIF / strip.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (no solar pulse, grain up), `Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (grain coord), `World/VaporMotes.cs` (alpha+count), `UI/WinScreen.cs` (layout y/size of margins, DEVELOPED, TIME, EXIF, LostCoda).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P. Exposure switch is now a clean colour fade (no flash). Grain should read across the scene; vapor wisps should be faintly visible rising. The win screen should no longer overlap. Tunables: grain `_grainT` in DarkroomPostDriver, vapor alpha in VaporMotes, win spacing in WinScreen. If grain is STILL invisible, the built-in Full Screen Pass may be sampling pre-grade — tell me and I'll move injection. Next: continue W4 (god-ray/ShadowCaster2D) + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 106 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W4 vapor reworked from "dust dots" into ethereal mist (Milestone 23.5a)
**Current Goal:** Student: the vapor reads as round dust dots — it should be ethereal/flowing.

### Student Prompt
(这个像灰尘一样的是蒸汽吗,不应该是飘渺的,流动的那种吗)

### Agent Response Summary
The old vapor used round SoftGlow discs → read as big dust dots. New: a dedicated `PixelArt.VaporWisp` sprite (128x64, elliptical falloff × value-noise, feathered to nothing → an irregular elongated cloud), and `VaporMotes` rewritten for ethereal motion — 7 LARGE stretched wisps (scale ~3-6 × 1.2-2.6, random tilt), faint base alpha 0.05-0.11, slow rise + sideways sin sway + slow rotation + per-wisp alpha BREATHING (form/dissipate) so overlapping wisps build a flowing haze instead of discrete dots.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (VaporWisp noisy elongated cloud sprite), `World/VaporMotes.cs` (rewrite: wisp sprite, stretch/tilt, sway, rotate, alpha breathing).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: vapor now drifts as soft, breathing, flowing wisps rather than round dots. Tunables in VaporMotes: Count, scale ranges, _baseA (alpha), DriftVel (rise speed), sway 0.06 / breathe speeds / rot speeds; and PixelArt.VaporWisp noise/shape. If it's too busy, drop Count or _baseA. Next: continue W4 (god-ray/ShadowCaster2D) + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 107 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W4 vapor → procedural FBM fog that gathers/disperses (Milestone 23.5b)
**Current Goal:** Student: the wisp-sprite vapor still looks fake (a texture sliding around) — fog should gather and disperse.

### Student Prompt
(还可以再优化,雾应该是会聚散的,现在就这个贴图飘来飘去很假)

### Agent Response Summary
Replaced the sprite-wisp approach with a procedural-noise fog SHADER so the fog actually evolves (forms/dissipates) and flows internally. New `Assets/Resources/Fog.shader` ("Darkroom/Fog"): domain-warped 4-octave FBM sampled in WORLD space, evolved by `_Time` (the +t terms), contrasted (`saturate(d*1.8-0.55)`) so there are clear gaps and dense clumps that drift = gather/disperse; tint+density from the SpriteRenderer vertex colour; soft edge mask fades the quad. `VaporMotes` rewritten: 3 large quads parented to the camera (always in view), each a Fog material with a different `_Scale`/`_Speed`/`_Seed` for layered parallax depth; cool faint colour; no per-frame C# (the shader self-animates). Graceful no-op if the shader is missing (no grey rectangle). Sort 31-33 (hazes the scene, stays behind the player).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW `Resources/Fog.shader` (+meta). `World/VaporMotes.cs` rewritten (3 camera-parented fog planes; dropped the wisp pool).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`). (Shader HLSL correctness verifies only in-engine.)

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: fog should now billow, flow, and gather/disperse instead of dots sliding. Tunables: VaporMotes sr.color alpha (density) + Layers; Fog.shader _Scale (cell size) / _Speed (drift) / the `*1.8-0.55` contrast (how clumpy). If it's too thick/covers the screen, drop the alphas or raise the -0.55. If it renders magenta, the HLSL has an error — tell me. Still open: confirm the emulsion GRAIN is visible now. Next: W4 god-ray/ShadowCaster2D + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 108 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Grain made filmic + fog refinements (settling gradient, exposure tint) (Milestone 23.5c)
**Current Goal:** Student asked what film grain should look like, and how to make the fog more natural/beautiful (already likes it).

### Student Prompt
(颗粒应该是什么样的,以及雾还能有什么地方做的更自然更漂亮吗,现在感觉已经挺不错)

### Agent Response Summary
Explained film grain: fine monochrome stochastic speckle, per-frame flicker (best seen in motion), strongest in mid/low tones and near-absent in highlights, screen-constant size. Made the grain more filmic in `DarkroomPost.shader`: weight now PEAKS in mid/low tones and fades in highlights (`w = saturate(1 - |luma-0.42|*1.6)`, was shadow-only ramp) and sampled slightly coarser (×0.75 res).

Fog refinements: (1) `Fog.shader` vertical SETTLING gradient — `mask *= 0.55 + 0.45*(1-uv.y)` so the haze pools low and thins upward (heavier air). (2) `VaporMotes` now re-tints the fog per exposure — cool-blue in Under, warm in Over, neutral in Normal (lerped) — so the haze belongs to the room's light (subscribes to ExposureManager; tint kept in C#, no global → no black-fog risk).

Offered further opt-in fog ideas (not yet built): light-reactive glow where lamp cones fall (volumetric), density anchored to the wet-side trays, a far thin layer + near wisp layer for more depth.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (grain midtone-weighted + coarser), `Resources/Fog.shader` (vertical settling), `World/VaporMotes.cs` (exposure-reactive tint + listener).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P. Grain should read as a fine flicker over the mid-tones (crank DarkroomPostDriver _grainT to confirm, then dial back). Fog now pools low, thins up, and shifts cool/warm with the exposure. Optional next fog polish if wanted: glow near the lamp cones, tray-anchored density, extra depth layers. Continuing W4 god-ray/ShadowCaster2D + W6 audio otherwise.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 109 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Shader include bug fixed + fog depth layers + top-lit glow (Milestone 23.5d)
**Current Goal:** Student (3 shader errors before play): DarkroomPost can't open Blit.hlsl; also wanted "fog glows near light" and "far + near fog layers for depth".

### Student Prompt
(运行前有三个bug,遇光发亮和多一层远景薄雾 + 一层近景丝雾:景深更强也做做)

### Agent Response Summary
BUGFIX: the 3 errors were `DarkroomPost.shader` failing to open `Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/Blit.hlsl` — in URP 17 Blit.hlsl MOVED to the core package. Changed the include to `Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/Runtime/Utilities/Blit.hlsl`, and removed my own `float4 _BlitTexture_TexelSize;` (the core Blit.hlsl already declares it — would have been a redefinition). (Fog.shader only includes universal Core.hlsl, so it was unaffected.)

FOG DEPTH: `VaporMotes` 3→5 layers driven by per-layer arrays — far (big slow soft clumps, sort 6, behind the scene) through near (fine fast wisps, sort 56, IN FRONT of the player) — `_Scale` 0.05→0.24, `_Speed` 0.03→0.12, alpha peaks mid (0.07/0.09/0.10/0.07/0.05). Real parallax depth.

FOG "遇光发亮": `Fog.shader` now brightens + warms toward the TOP of the frame (`lit = 0.8 + 0.6*uv.y`, warm lerp by uv.y) — a cheap approximation of the overhead hanging lamps catching the haze (true per-lamp glow would need feeding light positions into the shader; offered as opt-in).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (Blit include path → core; removed TexelSize redecl), `Resources/Fog.shader` (top-lit warm glow), `World/VaporMotes.cs` (5 depth layers via arrays).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`); include path verified pointing at the core package.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R — the 3 shader errors should be GONE (Console clean), and the DarkroomPost grain/halation actually renders now (the feature was erroring out before). ⌘P: fog now has far→near depth (a wisp drifts in front of the girl) and brightens toward the lamps up top. Tunables: VaporMotes LScale/LSpeed/LAlpha/LSort arrays; Fog.shader `lit` glow. True per-lamp fog glow is an opt-in if wanted. Next: W4 god-ray/ShadowCaster2D + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 110 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Grain fixed — "broken TV static" → clean film grain (Milestone 23.5e)
**Current Goal:** Grain now visible but reads as messy vertical-streak TV static.

### Student Prompt
(修好以后能看见颗粒了,但是感觉像电视机屏幕坏了一样,很杂乱)

### Agent Response Summary
Three causes of the "broken TV" look, all fixed: (1) the old `frac(p.x*p.y)` hash produces AXIS-ALIGNED STREAKS at large pixel coordinates → replaced with the robust Dave-Hoskins hash (`p3=frac(p.xyx*0.1031); p3+=dot(p3,p3.yzx+33.33); frac((p3.x+p3.y)*p3.z)`). (2) `_DR_Time` was `Time.time` (grows forever → the grain coord magnitude grows → precision drift → worsening streaks) → driver now sends `Random.value` (bounded [0,1], fresh per frame = clean film flicker). (3) amount too high → `_grainT` Under/Normal/Over 0.18/0.15/0.10 → 0.10/0.08/0.055; grain coord slightly coarser (×0.6).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (Hoskins hash, coarser grain coord), `Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (_DR_Time = Random.value; grain amounts down).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: grain should now be a fine, even, flickering film tooth — no vertical streaks, not static-y. Tunables: DarkroomPostDriver _grainT (lower = subtler), shader grain coord ×0.6 (smaller = chunkier). If still too busy, drop _grainT to ~0.05. Next: W4 god-ray/ShadowCaster2D + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 111 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Grain animation — crossfade instead of discrete reseed (Milestone 23.5f)
**Current Goal:** 60fps reseed felt too busy; 14fps hold-then-jump felt stuttery ("卡"). Wanted a better method.

### Student Prompt
(频率调低了又会觉得卡,有没有什么更好的办法)

### Agent Response Summary
The stutter came from the DISCRETE reseed (hold a static field N frames, then snap). Switched to a continuous TWO-SEED CROSSFADE: the shader samples two grain fields (`_DR_GrainA`, `_DR_GrainB`) and lerps by `_DR_GrainMix`, VARIANCE-NORMALISED (`* rsqrt((1-m)^2 + m^2)`) so grain intensity stays constant across the blend (no 0.5-point dimming pulse). `DarkroomPostDriver` advances `_gMix += dt*grainFps`; when it passes 1 it rolls B→A and draws a fresh B — so the field is always smoothly morphing, never held-then-jumped and never a 60fps boil. Rate is one knob: `grainFps` (default 16, public/Inspector-exposed). Removed the old `_DR_Time`/hold path.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Resources/DarkroomPost.shader` (two-seed variance-normalised crossfade; `_DR_Time` → `_DR_GrainA/B/Mix`), `Core/DarkroomPostDriver.cs` (crossfade advance + `grainFps` knob; dropped reseed-hold).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: grain should now morph smoothly — neither boiling nor stuttering. One knob: DarkroomPostDriver.grainFps (lower = lazier morph, higher = livelier; ~10-20 is the filmic range). Amount still _grainT, coarseness still the ×0.42 in the shader. Next: W4 god-ray/ShadowCaster2D + W6 audio.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 112 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W6 audio — per-exposure submix + Over-only shade threat layer (Milestone 23.6)
**Current Goal:** Continue the program (audio). Student said grain is good, "continue".

### Student Prompt
(还不错,继续下面的内容)

### Agent Response Summary
Did W6 within the existing fully-procedural AudioDirector (no AudioMixer asset — can't be created at runtime; the "code-only" route). Two clearly-audible, low-risk, on-theme additions making the three exposures sonically distinct (STORY §3 "the three states are the master submix"):
1. Per-exposure MUSIC low-pass: moved `_music` onto its own child GameObject with an `AudioLowPassFilter` (so SFX one-shots on the main object stay crisp). `HandleExposure` sets `_musicCutTarget` — Under 900Hz (muffled/sheltered), Normal 5000Hz, Over 22000Hz (open/exposed); `Update` glides `_musicLP.cutoffFrequency` toward it.
2. Over-only predatory shade layer: new `_threat` source + `BuildThreatDrone()` (dissonant 58/61.4Hz minor-second beat under a 174Hz top + a slow 0.5Hz swell — dread, not a jump-scare), gated to OVER (`_threatTarget` = Over ? 0.06 : 0), ducked with the ambience bed. Under/Normal stay silent on the threat ("sleeping stone").

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (music on a child + AudioLowPassFilter driven per exposure; `_threat` source + `BuildThreatDrone()`; HandleExposure + Update wiring).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`). (Audio verifies by ear, not screenshot.)

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, then switch exposures and LISTEN: Under should muffle/close the music (sheltered), Over should open it bright AND add a low dissonant dread drone; Normal sits between. Tunables in AudioDirector: `_musicCutTarget` cutoffs, `_threatTarget` level, BuildThreatDrone freqs. Remaining W6 (bigger): the developing leitmotif across 11 frames + Basinski decay arc. Remaining W4: god-ray shafts + ShadowCaster2D real shadows. Say which next.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 113 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W6 audio — made the per-exposure difference audible w/o music + on laptops (Milestone 23.6a)
**Current Goal:** Student: the audio change isn't obvious — is it on the loaded background music?

### Student Prompt
(好像不太明显,是加载背景音乐上的吗)

### Agent Response Summary
Confirmed: the low-pass was on the LOADED music (`_music` child) — so with no file in StreamingAssets/music it does nothing. Also the per-exposure beds were bass-heavy (hum 55Hz, threat 58Hz) which laptop speakers can't reproduce → "not obvious". Fix: lean on the always-on PROCEDURAL beds and give them audible mids. Boosted `_humTarget` 0.22→0.30 (Under), `_hissTarget` 0.12→0.17 (Over), `_threatTarget` 0.06→0.16 (Over). Added MID partials to `BuildThreatDrone` (220Hz + a dissonant 233Hz beat) on top of the sub-bass, so the Over dread is audible on laptop speakers regardless of music. Left the music low-pass in (a bonus when a music file is present; commented as such).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (hum/hiss/threat levels up; BuildThreatDrone gains 220/233Hz mids).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, switch to OVER and LISTEN — you should now clearly hear a bright hiss + a low dissonant dread drone (with an audible 220/233Hz beat) that are absent in Under/Normal. Under stays intentionally quiet/sheltered (mostly sub-bass, so near-silent on laptop speakers — that's by design; the contrast is "quiet shelter → exposed danger"). The music low-pass is a bonus that only bites if you drop an .ogg/.wav/.mp3 in StreamingAssets/music. Tunables: _humTarget/_hissTarget/_threatTarget. Next: keep going on W6 (developing leitmotif) or jump to W4 (god-ray/shadows)?)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 114 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W6 — developing leitmotif across the 11 frames (Milestone 23.6b)
**Current Goal:** Student asked if the developing leitmotif is hard; build a first version.

### Student Prompt
(挺好,W6发展型主题动机难做吗)

### Agent Response Summary
Answered: mechanically not hard (the per-room `SetRoomMood` hook already fires on frame entry; tone synthesis already exists) — the hard part is MUSICAL TASTE, which needs the student's ear since I can't hear it. Built a first version in AudioDirector: a 5-note A-minor-pentatonic phrase (A C E D C) of soft struck `BuildTone` bells, played one note at a time by a new `UpdateMotif` sequencer on a slow loop. Development by frame (`_motifStage`, latched to the max room so it never un-develops): `revealed = clamp(1 + (stage-1)/2, 1, 5)` — Frame 1 a single lone note, +1 note ~every 2 frames, full phrase by the late frames; a warm `BuildMotifPad` (A3/E4/A4) fades in from ~frame 5; the inter-phrase rest shortens as it develops (more present late). Soft (~0.10), ducked with the bed, silent in prologue/cinematic/win — rationed so it's fullest only near the self-portrait (STORY §3).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/AudioDirector.cs` (motif fields; build note clips + pad in Awake; `_motifStage` in SetRoomMood; `UpdateMotif` in Update; `BuildTone` + `BuildMotifPad`).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P and LISTEN across frames: early on, a sparse lone struck note every few seconds; as you advance, more of the phrase appears + a warm pad joins, fuller and more present toward the end. It's a first pass to tune BY EAR — tunables: MotifPhrase note set (swap the Hz for a different melody), note gap 0.72s, rest 5.5s, reveal rate `(stage-1)/2`, levels. Remaining W6: the Basinski decay arc (the bed audibly eroding toward the finale). W4 still open: god-ray/shadows. Tell me melody tweaks or which next.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 115 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W4 — procedural volumetric god-ray shafts on the lamps (Milestone 23.7)
**Current Goal:** Do W4, carefully designed to be as refined/natural as the fog.

### Student Prompt
(先做W4 吧,仔细设计,达到像雾一样精致自然的效果)

### Agent Response Summary
Matched the fog's procedural quality for light. New `Assets/Resources/LightShaft.shader` ("Darkroom/LightShaft"): an additive volumetric god-ray — a cone (narrow+bright at the bulb via `halfW = lerp(0.06,0.5,1-uv.y)`, soft squared edges), bright-near-source vertical falloff (`pow(uv.y,0.5)`), and FBM DUST sampled in world space scrolling/settling downward (`Fbm(wpos*scale + (seed, t*1.5))`, kept in [0.5,1]) so the beam reads as motes caught in light — alive, not a flat sprite. Tint/density from the SpriteRenderer vertex colour. Reused the proven Fog shader structure (Core.hlsl + Hoskins hash + FBM). Wired into `BackdropBuilder.Lamp`: replaced the flat `PixelArt.LightBeam` sprite with a shaft quad (2.6×5.6, top at the bulb, sort -5, warm `(1,0.90,0.72,0.40)`), each lamp a Material instance with randomised `_Speed/_Scale/_Seed`; graceful fallback to the old flat beam if the shader is absent. Cached `ShaftShader` getter. The chunky `beamDust` Drift motes are kept (complements the shader's fine dust).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
NEW `Resources/LightShaft.shader` (+meta). `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (ShaftShader cache; lamp beam → volumetric shaft with fallback).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`). (Shader HLSL verifies in-engine.)

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: each lamp should now cast a soft cone with dust slowly drifting down inside it — light made volumetric, fog-quality. Tunables: in BackdropBuilder.Lamp the shaft `ssr.color` alpha (density), localScale (length/width), and `_Speed/_Scale`; in LightShaft.shader the cone `lerp(0.06,0.5,...)` and `pow(uv.y,0.5)` falloff. If 20 additive shafts read too bright, drop the alpha to ~0.28. Remaining W4: ShadowCaster2D real cast-shadows (harder/harsher — separate polish). W6 left: Basinski decay arc.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 116 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** W4 god-ray polish — soft bottom dissolve + dimmer (Milestone 23.7a)
**Current Goal:** Central shaft too bright; the beam's end looked hard-cut.

### Student Prompt
(最中轴那一束光太亮了,然后光的末尾消失的有点奇怪,感觉被硬切了)

### Agent Response Summary
Hard-cut bottom: `vfall = pow(uv.y, 0.5)` ramps too steeply near 0 → visible edge. Changed to `smoothstep(0.04, 0.72, uv.y)` — flat at 0, so the beam dissolves softly to nothing (no edge). Too bright: lowered the shaft density alpha 0.40 → 0.24 (the central one read brightest because the additive shaft stacks on the bulb's HDR glow and sits under the camera centre).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Resources/LightShaft.shader` (vfall → smoothstep soft dissolve), `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs` (shaft alpha 0.40 → 0.24).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: beam tails now dissolve softly, overall dimmer. Tunables: shaft alpha (→0.18 for fainter), LightShaft.shader smoothstep `0.72` (higher = bright band sits higher / dissolves sooner). If the SOURCE point is still too hot, that's the lamp's HDR bulb/srcGlow stacking — say so and I'll dial those. W4 remaining: ShadowCaster2D; W6 remaining: Basinski decay.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 117 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Opening UI fixes — cinematic chrome, hint timing, exposure-card gating + redesign (Milestone 24)
**Current Goal:** Prologue reveal: a hint overlaps it, the top "bar" (slider) clips during the cinematic; the EXPOSURE card pops too early (R1-2); redesign the card.

### Student Prompt
(开头第一章这个 UI 先调一下,提示不应该这会儿还重合上;因为画幅变化顶部那个条被截了一段也很怪;关卡设计变化后第一二关下方又出现 normal 这些介绍很不合理;把他们调到应该出现的时刻,介绍卡片重新精心设计)

### Agent Response Summary
The bright screen = `GameManager.PrologueExitRoutine` (IsCinematic) showing the giant photo-paper; the gameplay HUD + the "Bring back the room." hint weren't hidden during it. Fixes in HUDController:
1. CINEMATIC CHROME: a `_chromeAlpha` lerps to 0 when `IsCinematic || HasWon`; drives a new CanvasGroup on the exposure slider (the "top bar") so it fades out during the prologue reveal / finale. The hint bubble is now force-hidden while `IsCinematic` (Update + a guard in ShowHintNow) — no more overlap.
2. CARD TIMING: `ShowCard` now requires `gm.HasFlash` (exposure only becomes a real 3-state choice once the Flash is acquired in R2/R3) and bails during cinematics — so it never pops in R1 just for the boot-granted Under/Normal toggle. Range simplified to x<48 (tutorial stretch).
3. CARD REDESIGN: rebuilt as a darkroom contact-card — film-base panel + thin warm hairline, a sprocket accent down the left, an "E X P O S U R E" mono eyebrow over the state name (display face), the explanation, and three state DOTS (under=cold blue / normal=neutral / over=warm) with the current one lit (set in ShowCard).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (_sliderCg + _chromeAlpha chrome fade; hint hidden during cinematics; ShowCard HasFlash gate + state-dot coloring + StateDotLit; BuildCard redesign with sprocket accent + dots; _cardDots field).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, replay the prologue: during the paper-door reveal the slider + hint should fade away (clean cinematic); the EXPOSURE card no longer appears in R1 — it shows only after you pick up the Flash, restyled as a film card with lit state dots. If a "top bar" still clips in NORMAL play at some aspect (not the cinematic), tell me which element and I'll fix the safe-area. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Interaction 118 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Top HUD header scrim + centered exposure card (Milestone 24.1)
**Current Goal:** The exposure card layout still poor (left-jammed); the top HUD feels incongruous (washes out on bright Over, three styles floating).

### Student Prompt
(暗房联系卡排版还是不太好,然后顶部 HUD 还是会有点不协调,怎么安排更合理)

### Agent Response Summary
Design rationale given + implemented:
1. TOP HUD: added a `BuildTopScrim` — a full-width soft dark gradient (`PixelArt.TopGradient`, opaque at the top edge → transparent ~230px down) behind the room title / exposure slider / controls, so the header reads on ANY background (bright Over included) and the three elements cohere into one designed strip instead of floating chrome. Driven by a CanvasGroup `_topCg` faded with `_chromeAlpha` (gone during cinematics with the slider).
2. CARD: rebuilt centered + balanced — symmetric sprocket accents down BOTH edges; centered "E X P O S U R E" mono eyebrow → state name (display, now state-TINTED via StateDotLit) → a centered row of three state dots (current lit) → centered body. 560×138, tidy breathing room (was the left-jammed 620-wide panel).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (TopGradient vertical-fade sprite), `UI/HUDController.cs` (_topCg + BuildTopScrim + call + chrome fade; BuildCard centered/symmetric redesign; ShowCard title state-tint).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`). (SilhouetteArt also gained split-rig sprites externally — the W3 player-rig work — unaffected.)

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: the top now sits on a soft gradient header (readable on the bright Over wall); the exposure card is centered + balanced with a state-tinted name and a lit dot row. Tunables: TopScrim height 230 / color alpha 0.5 (stronger = darker header); card size/spacing in BuildCard. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 119 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Player split-rig + procedural secondary motion (W3 player-rig)
**Current Goal:** Make the girl come alive — walking: skirt hem trails back + body leans forward; jump/land: skirt + hair swing. Student believed a "bone framework" was already in; design + wire it.

### Student Prompt
(考虑一下重新设计人物,我应该已经加入了骨骼框架,我想让走起来的时候裙摆会向后,身体会前倾。然后跳起来和落地的时候裙子、头发也会有摆动,该怎么设计和操作)

### Agent Response Summary
First corrected the premise: there was NO real skeleton. The player was a single baked silhouette (`SilhouetteArt.Girl()` → one 42×78 texture, skirt + bun baked in); `CharacterRig.cs` + the 2D Animation package were unused scaffolding (no `.prefab`, no `Resources/Characters/` on disk; the player never calls `CharacterRig.Load`). Student chose the **pure-code transform-joint** approach (no SpriteSkin / editor authoring) over Unity skinned bones.

Implemented a split "code rig" driven by a spring-damper, reusing the project's own joint precedent (the background worker's top-pivot arm on a joint, `RigActor`/`BackdropFigures`, and the `ToSprite(…, pivot)` overload):
1. **Sprite split** (`SilhouetteArt`): kept whole `Girl()` for baked poses; added `GirlCore()` (body minus the A-line flare & bun, **plus a hip/torso STEM** ~3px narrower per side than the skirt so a swinging hem never reveals the dark backdrop through the midsection), `GirlSkirt()` (standalone A-line, **waist top-pivot**), `GirlHair()` (standalone bun, pivot derived from the **crown attach point** tex (18,67), not the bun centre). New accessors + `EnsurePlayer` wiring.
2. **Rig + driver** (`PlayerAnimator`): hierarchy `Player → Lean(forward-lean rotation + facing scale.x=±1, replaces sr.flipX) → Visual(squash/stretch + develop; Body + Aura)`, with `SkirtJoint`/`HairJoint` as **siblings of Visual** (outside the non-uniform squash, so their rotations don't shear). Per frame in the facing-local frame: lean target `−LeanMax·s` via SmoothDamp; skirt/hair as semi-implicit damped springs `vel += (−k(θ−target) − d·vel)dt` with targets trailing back ∝ speed; **jump/land angular impulses reuse the existing grounded-edge blocks** (land impulse scaled by the same `/15` fall reference as the squash). `SetVisible/SetPose/ClearPose/DevelopRoutine` extended to all three renderers + spring reset so death/respawn, prologue paper-turn and finale (which use whole baked sprites) hide the overlays and never double the skirt/bun.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/SilhouetteArt.cs` (GirlCore/GirlSkirt/GirlHair + PlayerBody*/PlayerSkirt/PlayerHair accessors + EnsurePlayer), `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (Lean/Visual/SkirtJoint/HairJoint hierarchy; facing-via-scale; lean + two damped springs; jump/land impulses; overlay-aware pose/visibility/develop). No GameManager change needed.

### Immediate Result
The two changed scripts COMPILE OK (`-warnaserror`) — isolated proof: csc's only two errors are pre-existing in `HUDController.cs` (the student's in-progress Interaction-118 HUD work: `BuildTopScrim`/`_topCg` scope split), unrelated to the rig. That break must be resolved before the project builds.

### Student Follow-up
(First fix HUDController.cs (your WIP) — or ask me — so the project compiles. Then ⌘R → ⌘P: walk → body leans forward + hem trails back; jump/drop → skirt + hair swing and settle in a beat or two. Check: L/R symmetry (mirror not reversed), no dark sliver behind the swinging hem (widen the GirlCore stem hw 11 → 12/13 if one shows), and that death/respawn + prologue + finale show no doubled skirt/bun. Tunables in PlayerAnimator: LeanMax 7 / SkirtFlowMax 14 / HairFlowMax 6, spring f/ζ (Skirt 2.2Hz·0.30, Hair 2.8Hz·0.30), JumpKick 220/160, LandKick 260/200 — flip a kick's sign if the swing direction reads wrong; if center-pivot lean makes the feet slide, move the lean to a feet-pivot node. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 119 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Top HUD recomputed into a coherent 3-column header (Milestone 24.2)
**Current Goal:** Make the cursive title, the centre exposure bar, and the right-side controls visually harmonious.

### Student Prompt
(顶部 HUD 重新算一下怎么排版,包括怎么让这个花体字幕,bar 和右边操作在视觉上保持和谐)

### Agent Response Summary
Re-laid the header on a 3-column grid: symmetric 48px L/R margins; LEFT title + RIGHT controls TOP-ALIGNED at y -36; the centre exposure bar slightly higher (caption y -24) as the interactive focal point; the left objective line and the bar's UNDER/NORMAL/OVER labels share the lower band (~-86). Typographic hierarchy clarified: the cursive frame title is the single decorative voice (shrunk 42→38 so it no longer overpowers); everything functional speaks one mono voice — the bar caption is now the SAME letter-spaced dim eyebrow ("E X P O S U R E", 15pt) as the tutorial card, the objective and controls are mono/dim (controls 16→15, lineSpacing 1.5). All of it sits on the new top scrim so it reads on any background.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` — BuildRoomInfo (title 38 @ x48/-34, objective x50/-86), BuildControlsBlock (right x-48/-36, 15pt), BuildExposureSlider (group y-24, caption → letter-spaced 15pt eyebrow).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: the header now reads as three aligned columns — cursive title left, exposure bar centre (focal), controls right — same margins, aligned tops, one mono label voice on the gradient scrim. Tunables: the y values (-34/-36/-24/-86) and 48px margins in BuildRoomInfo/BuildControlsBlock/BuildExposureSlider. If you want the title even smaller or the bar lower, single-number nudges. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

**Development Stage:** Prologue film scratches made convincing (Milestone 24.3)
**Current Goal:** The opening's scratch lines look fake.

### Student Prompt
(开头第一关那些裂痕太假了,修一修)

### Agent Response Summary
The prologue scratches were a solid `WhiteSprite` rectangle (0.014 x len) — perfectly straight, crisp, uniform = fake. Added `PixelArt.FilmScratch`: a procedural emulsion-scratch texture (10x160) — a feathered hairline whose centre WANDERS (`ValueNoise` ±2px meander), BREAKS UP along its length (noise-modulated 0.18..1 opacity), and TAPERS at both ends. `BuildScratch` now uses it (localScale 0.7 x len, ~0.044u wide) with deterministic flipX/flipY per position so the four don't read as repeats. Kept SpriteMat + the desaturated grey-blue colour + the director's fade-in-under-safelight behaviour.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (FilmScratch sprite), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (BuildScratch uses it + flip variety + scale).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, prologue under the safelight: the scratches should now read as wandering, broken, feathered film damage rather than crisp sticks. Tunables: PixelArt.FilmScratch wander x4 / break-up noise / feather 1.7px; LevelBuilder scratch placement array + PrologueDirector.ScratchMax 0.28 for overall faintness. The door-seam "cracks" (R0_DoorCrackA/B) are still thin straight overlay lines — say if those also read fake and I'll give them the same treatment. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 121 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Door cracks + square checkpoint print + lost-frame polish (Milestone 24.4)
**Current Goal:** The prologue DOOR cracks still look fake; the checkpoint print is still too flat (make it square); the hidden lost-frame collectible is too crude.

### Student Prompt
(序章门里面的划痕也调一调,然后存档点那个相纸造型还是太瘪做成正方形,遗失的相片现在也做的太粗糙)

### Agent Response Summary
1. DOOR CRACKS: `R0_DoorCrackA/B` were solid straight overlay lines. Added `BuildCrack` (same wandering/broken/feathered `PixelArt.FilmScratch` hairline as the wall scratches, but dark + per-position flip) and swapped the two cracks to it; still added to dir.Overlays so the director fades them in under the safelight. (The vertical door SEAM stays a clean line — it's the door edge.)
2. CHECKPOINT PRINT: `PixelArt.PrintFrame` 44x46 → **48x48 SQUARE**, with a 33x33 square photo window + a ~13px Polaroid bottom margin (was a wider-than-tall window that read flat/squished).
3. LOST FRAME: rebuilt `LevelBuilder.Lost` from a tiled-grain box into a small FRAMED print — an un-scaled trigger GO (still ONE root child, validator-safe) with two child visuals: a `PrintFrame` cool undeveloped-negative + a faint cool `SoftGlow` halo (allure). No longer a crude grain rectangle.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs` (PrintFrame → 48x48 square), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (BuildCrack + door cracks use it; Lost rebuilt as framed print + halo, one root child preserved).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P. Door cracks now wander/break like the wall scratches; the checkpoint print is square (Polaroid-ish); the hidden lost frame reads as a small cool framed negative with a halo. Tunables: BuildCrack scale 0.55/len; PrintFrame window insets; Lost frame `fit`/glow alpha + the cool tint. Validator root-child count unchanged (lost frame still one child). Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 122 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Bugfix — checkpoint visuals stretched 2x vertically (Milestone 24.5)
**Current Goal:** The checkpoint print still looked wrong (too tall) — student suspected a logic bug.

### Student Prompt
(存档点相纸还是不对,查一查是不是有缺漏或者代码逻辑问题)

### Agent Response Summary
Root cause found: `CheckpointAt` builds the trigger via `NewTrigger(name, c, (1,2))`, which sets `go.transform.localScale = (1,2)` for the catch box. All the marker visuals (print, cord, clip, glow) are CHILDREN of `go`, so they inherited the (1,2) and were stretched 2× VERTICALLY — the square PrintFrame rendered 1:2 tall, which is why making PrintFrame square earlier didn't help (the parent was stretching it). Fix: counter-scale the `marker` to `(1, 0.5)` so its net world scale is (1,1) — the square print renders square and all parts/positions are correct. (The collider lives on `go`, not the marker, so the 1×2 catch box is unchanged.)

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (CheckpointAt: `marker.localScale = (1, 0.5)` to cancel the trigger's non-uniform scale).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, reach a checkpoint: the print is now a proper SQUARE Polaroid with correctly-proportioned cord/clip/glow — the earlier "too flat/tall" was this 2× vertical stretch, not the sprite. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 123 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Design + mechanic — per-frame exposure reset (Milestone 25)
**Current Goal:** Decide whether to force exposure back to Normal on entering each new frame, then implement it.

### Student Prompt
(加一个机制,每到下一关强制回到normal 模式,这样做合理吗 → 我觉得可以每关都重置,我试了没问题)

### Agent Response Summary
First gave a grounded design read: the game is one continuous roll of 11 frames (not loaded levels); "mode" = `Exposure {Underexposed, Normal, Overexposed}`, the player's core continuous tool. Flagged that a blunt per-frame reset risks (a) diluting R9's blackout — the one authored "the world decides" beat (`ExposureManager.cs:17`), and (b) breaking any puzzle that carries an exposure-solid platform across a boundary. Student tested and confirmed no cross-boundary break, chose per-frame reset.
Implementation review surfaced strong alignment: `ScriptedBlackout.cs:144-151` ALREADY force-sets Normal on R9 arrival ("the drop must be a deliberate leap into the dark, not a freebie because you crossed in still Underexposed"), and frame 9's checkpoint caption is literally "nothing carries over. nothing ever does." So a global rule generalizes existing intent.
Implemented in `GameManager.Update` (not per-checkpoint — rooms 6/9/10 have multiple checkpoints sharing one room index): forward-only, once-per-frame tracker `_lastExposureResetRoom` keyed off `LevelData.RoomIndexAt(x)`; on a new higher frame, `em.ForceSet(Exposure.Normal, silent:true)`. Silent (backdrop tint shift is cue enough) and a no-op when already Normal (`ForceSet` early-returns on `next==Current`). Prologue (room 0) exempt (init 0). Bypasses the R9 lock safely (crossing happens before the lock arms; ForceSet ignores Locked anyway). Reset the tracker in `FullRestart` (replay re-arms) and set it in `WarpToRoom` (dev-warp coherence).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/GameManager.cs` — new `_lastExposureResetRoom` field; per-frame Normal reset in `Update` (inside the `em != null` block); tracker reset in `FullRestart`; tracker set in `WarpToRoom`.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(pending in-engine verify: ⌘R → ⌘P, carry Overexposed/Underexposed across a frame boundary → should snap to Normal silently on entry; R9 blackout choreography unchanged; replay via win screen resets per-frame again.)

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Immersion pass — real 2D shadows + camera life + spatial audio (Milestone 26)
**Current Goal:** Deepen scene immersion/atmosphere beyond the (already rich) existing stack.

### Student Prompt
(ok 了,还有什么办法提升场景的沉浸感和氛围感)

### Agent Response Summary
Mapped the existing atmosphere stack first (it's already deep: per-exposure Light2D + a full code-built PostFX grade, 5-layer domain-warped fog, god-ray light shafts, glass-refraction HUD, ambient/beam dust, working backdrop figures, scripted blackout, ~40 procedural sounds + reactive music). So the wins are the MISSING/DORMANT pieces. Notable finding: `DarkroomPost.shader` (solarize/halation/grain) is fully written + fed globals every frame but never rendered (no ScriptableRendererFeature). Student chose three non-DarkroomPost directions; implemented all three (each independent, each Tier-1 `COMPILE OK -warnaserror`):

1. **Real 2D shadows (Part 1).** Read URP 17.4 source: `ShadowCaster2D.Awake()` auto-derives a box shape from the attached Collider2D — fully headless, no editor binding. The real work was the perf guardrail: Light2D ships shadows-ON (0.75), so once any caster exists EVERY `LightDirector.CreatePoint` light (dark paths, sensors, enemies, player glow) would silently cast → cliff. New `ShadowFactory.AddBoxCaster(go,size)` (CastShadow only + exact box path via cached reflection, graceful fallback); `CreatePoint` now defaults `shadowsEnabled=false` with a `castsShadows` opt-in (lamps only, intensity 0.55/softness 0.6); new `LampShadowCuller` keeps only the nearest 4 lamps casting (2D shadows render per-light serially). Casters on StaticGround (size floor) + Door (disabled on open so no ghost shadow) + the player (moving shadow).
2. **Camera life (Part 2).** `CameraFollow` gained `Instance` + speed-scaled Perlin idle breathing (only when still) + trauma² impact shake (sharp spike, fast settle, ≤0.45u/1.6°), self-contained speed from target-delta, cinematic/win suppression by reading `GameManager.IsCinematic/HasWon` (robust, no manual pairing). `AddTrauma` wired at landing (`PlayerAnimator`, scaled by fallSpeed/15), death (`GameManager.RespawnRoutine`), burn-through (`BurnPaper`). `PostFXDirector` gained `ChromaticAberration`+`LensDistortion` driven by a decaying `_jolt` on every non-silent exposure switch (Over strongest CA, Under pinches) + a tiny camera tick; coexists with the Over-only `_flash`; cleared in `ResetForRestart`.
3. **Spatial audio (Part 3).** One `AudioReverbFilter` on the AudioDirector GameObject wets the whole procedural mix at once (music is on a child → stays dry); `User` preset + custom room/decay glided per space via the existing `SetRoomMood` hook (tight darkroom −2200/0.6s, hollow R9 shaft −1400/1.6s, intimate prologue −2600/0.9s; collapses to silence on `HasWon`). Panning via computed `panStereo` from world-x on a NEW dedicated `_pos` one-shot bus (so pan never bleeds into the centered `_sfx`); positional plays (door, burn-through, umbra, fix-platform, enemy wake/freeze) + the lift/burn beds carry `worldX`; player/UI/music stay centered.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
New: `Core/ShadowFactory.cs`, `World/LampShadowCuller.cs` (+ hand-made metas). Part 1: `Core/LightDirector.cs`, `Level/LevelBuilder.cs`, `Level/BackdropBuilder.cs`, `Player/PlayerController.cs`, `World/SensorDoor.cs`. Part 2: `Core/CameraFollow.cs`, `Core/PostFXDirector.cs`, `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs`, `Core/GameManager.cs`, `World/BurnPaper.cs`. Part 3: `Core/AudioDirector.cs` + worldX at `World/{SensorDoor,RiseLift,ShadowLift,FixPlatform,BurnPaper,UmbralBarrier,LightSensitiveEnemy}.cs`.

### Immediate Result
All three parts Tier-1 `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`); full tree now 0 errors (the earlier HUDController WIP got fixed in the interim). Editor was open, so the batchmode validator was skipped.

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P to verify each: (1) stand under a lamp on a wide ledge → soft moving shadow from the platform + the player; only nearest ~4 lamps cast (watch for distant snap = culler — tune N/interval); shadows soften in Under, none from red safelights, none strobing across DarkPath/bridges. (2) idle → faint breathing, gone when walking; big drop → sharp shake settling <1s; small hop ≈ none; switch 1/2/3 → brief CA+distortion pulse (Over strongest, Under pinch), silent on respawn/R9; pause freezes; cinematics stay composed. (3) headphones: pan a lift/door/enemy L→C→R, clamped at screen edge; room 0→1 prologue→darkroom tail; R9 shaft hollow+long; finale silence absolute. Tunables: lamp `maxCasters`/`shadowIntensity`; CameraFollow `BreatheAmp`/`ShakeMaxOffset`/`TraumaDecay`; PostFX `CA*`/`Lens*`/`JoltDecay`; AudioDirector reverb table + `PanAmount`. Deferred high-ROI option still on the table: wiring the dormant DarkroomPost full-screen pass.)

**Development Stage:** Mechanic + game-feel — Shutter pickup embodiment (Milestone 26)
**Current Goal:** The Shutter pickup felt useless / the pickup→ability chain wasn't legible. Make the acquisition read ON the character.

### Student Prompt
(Frame 5 里人物面对的那个小蓝眼睛是什么 → 拿了可以干啥呢,好像并没有什么联系,捡了这个解锁「画线」能力的逻辑链不够直观完整,比如说可以捡了人物有些变化?)

### Agent Response Summary
Identified the element: the **Shutter ability pickup** (`R5` PickupDef at 64,5.4) — `PixelArt.ShutterPickup` is a camera-aperture icon (blue ring + dark pupil) that reads as an eye. Confirmed it IS functional: `TrailSystem.cs:57 canDraw = gm.HasShutter` — drawing is hard-gated by it. But ALL feedback was peripheral HUD (banner + TRAILS dots + white flash) and the icon just `Destroy`s — nothing on the avatar, so the chain felt broken. Student's instinct (人物有些变化) was right and the game already carries the motif: `SilhouetteArt.PlayerShoot` = "the lens glint replaces the glowing eye — she sees through it now", used only in the finale today.
Asked direction; student chose **举相机瞬间 + 永久镜头眼**.
Implemented (offline, all baked sprites — no new assets):
- **PlayerAnimator**: added a persistent **lens-eye overlay** (cool halo + bright core, GlowMat) parented under `Visual` at the eye texel (25.5,63.5)@60ppu → local (0.075,0.408); the Lean `scale.x=±1` mirror flips it for free. Disabled until Shutter. New API `GainShutterEye()` (ignite + punch-in once any pose clears via `LensRevealRoutine`), `ResetShutterEye()`, `EyeWorldPos`, and a `SetLensShown()` helper hooked into SetPose/ClearPose/SetVisible/PlayDevelopIn/DevelopRoutine so it hides whenever a baked pose carries its own glint.
- **GameManager**: `AcquireShutter()`→`ShutterPickupRoutine` — Unlock (keeps HUD/audio/flash), disable input + zero x-vel, `SetPose(PlayerShoot)` (she raises the camera), a cool ingest glow flies from the pad UP into her eye (~0.38s ease-out, shrinking/fading), then `GainShutterEye()` + a cool StrokeSparkle + a soft develop "click", hold 0.28s, ClearPose + restore input (~0.7s beat). Reset the eye in FullRestart; grant it in WarpToRoom/WarpToLab for dev consistency.
- **AbilityPickup**: Shutter now routes to `AcquireShutter(pos)` (other abilities unchanged).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (lens-eye overlay + API + visibility hooks), `Core/GameManager.cs` (Shutter pickup beat; FullRestart/warp eye state), `World/AbilityPickup.cs` (route Shutter to the beat).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(pending in-engine verify: ⌘R → ⌘P, reach Frame 5, walk into the shutter → she lifts the camera, its light is drawn into her eye, and a cool lens-glint stays on her eye for the rest of the run. Tunables: lens halo/core color+alpha (`PlayerAnimator.Attach`), EyeLocal offset, ingest `dur`/colors + beat hold (`ShutterPickupRoutine`). Other two pickups (Negative/Flash) still HUD-only — could get their own beats later.)

## Interaction 125 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Tuning — camera-shake feel + exposure-card padding (Milestone 26.1)
**Current Goal:** The new camera shake is too violent (esp. jump/land); shrink it ~1/3+. Fix the NORMAL exposure card whose bottom body line kisses the border.

### Student Prompt
(抖动太剧烈了,尤其是跳起来和落下的。全局收缩现在的 1/3 甚至更多,特别剧烈的可以再多调整一点。normal 卡片的这个 UI 显示还是不太对,最下面一行文字贴着边框了)

### Agent Response Summary
1. **Shake.** Root cause of "jump/land too violent": every routine hop returns at ~12.5 u/s and `_lastFallSpeed/15` made that a trauma ≈0.5 → a real jolt on EVERY landing. Two fixes: (a) global amplitude to ~1/3 — `CameraFollow.ShakeMaxOffset 0.45→0.14`, `ShakeMaxRoll 1.6→0.45`; (b) landing trauma re-mapped from `f*0.6` to `clamp01((_lastFallSpeed−13)/10)*0.6` so routine hops produce ~0 shake and only real drops (R9) ramp up. Trimmed the loudest sources further: death `0.55→0.45`, burn-through `0.4→0.3`. Squash/land-audio still use the original `f` (unchanged).
2. **Card.** The exposure card (`HUDController.BuildCard`) is bottom-anchored (pivot (0.5,0)@y70) with top-anchored content; the body box bottom sat at −136 from the card top while the card was only 138 tall → the 2nd line ("No trails can be drawn.") had ~2px to the bottom hairline. Grew the card height `138→150`; since content is pinned to the top, the extra 12px is pure bottom padding (~14px clearance now), top padding unchanged.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/CameraFollow.cs` (shake amplitude consts), `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (landing trauma remap), `Core/GameManager.cs` + `World/BurnPaper.cs` (death/burn trauma), `UI/HUDController.cs` (card height 138→150).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: routine jumps/landings should barely move the camera now; only a big drop (R9) lands a soft thump; death/burn gentler. NORMAL (and all exposure) cards: bottom body line now clears the border. Further knobs if needed: shake floor/ceiling = `CameraFollow.ShakeMaxOffset/ShakeMaxRoll`; routine-hop deadzone = the `−13` / `/10` in `PlayerAnimator` landing; card padding = the `150` height in `BuildCard`.)

### Follow-up fix (Interaction 124.1)

**Bug:** the M26 beat never fired in-engine — `AbilityPickup.OnTriggerEnter2D` still called `GameManager.Unlock(ability)` directly. The Shutter→`AcquireShutter` routing described above was authored in `GameManager`/`PlayerAnimator` but the one-line wiring in `AbilityPickup` was missed, so `AcquireShutter`/`ShutterPickupRoutine` were dead code (compiled clean, never reached). Student reported "没有出现这个姿势,这些动画也都没有".

**Fix:** `World/AbilityPickup.cs` now routes `Ability.Shutter` → `gm.AcquireShutter(transform.position)` (other abilities still `gm.Unlock`). Offline `COMPILE OK`.

**Caveat surfaced:** `AcquireShutter` early-returns when `HasShutter` is already true — so reaching Frame 5 via **dev-warp `]`** (which pre-grants all abilities) means the real pickup will NOT play the ceremony. To see the beat, reach Frame 5 by playing, or test the eye-state via warp separately. Also: ⌘R (Assets→Refresh) before ⌘P or Unity runs the stale assembly.

## Interaction 126 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Tuning — idle camera breathing + walk-stop recenter (Milestone 26.2)
**Current Goal:** Standing-still camera drift is still too much / too fidgety; the walk→stop recenter glide rebounds too much.

### Student Prompt
(站立不动时的镜头抖动还是太多了太细碎了,以及往左往右走然后停下来那个镜头的回弹也太多了)

### Agent Response Summary
Both are `CameraFollow`. (1) **Idle breath** was a 2D Perlin wander (`BreatheAmp 0.06`, X+Y at 0.13/0.19Hz) — the independent X/Y read as a fidgety "细碎" drift. Made it **vertical-only**, `0.06→0.022` (~1/3), single slow `0.10Hz`, and **eased via a smoothed `_breath` (MoveTowards ~0.6s)** so it fades in after a stop instead of popping. Dropped the now-unused `_seedX` (would warn-as-error). (2) **Walk-stop rebound** = the SmoothDamp recenter glide whose length ∝ lag = `velocity*SmoothTime`. Tightened `SmoothTime 0.12→0.08` (lag at 7u/s 0.84u→0.56u), so less trail during a walk and a smaller, quicker recenter on stop. Shake amplitudes untouched (already cut last round).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/CameraFollow.cs` — breath: vertical-only + amp/freq + `_breath` ease + seed cleanup; `SmoothTime 0.12→0.08`.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: idle = a barely-there slow vertical breath, no fidget; walk then stop = the camera settles with much less glide. Knobs if still off: `BreatheAmp`/`BreatheFreq` + the `_breath` ease rate `1.6`; follow tightness = `SmoothTime` (lower = tighter/less rebound).)

### Follow-up fix (Interaction 124.2) — still no beat

**Investigation (exhaustive trace):**
- Audited every `HasShutter =` site + Bootstrap: in NORMAL play nothing grants Shutter before Frame 5 (Negative granted at boot, Flash is the only earlier pickup at R2). So a clean run reaches R5 with `HasShutter==false` and the routine SHOULD fire.
- `Temp/UnityLockfile` present → **the editor is open** (stale-assembly trap).
- Verified every symbol the routine touches (InputEnabled field, StrokeSparkle.Burst(Vector2,…), OrderPickup=45, PlayDevelop/PlayPickup) — all valid; runtime AND Editor scripts both `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`), so no compile error is forcing a stale assembly.

**Root cause (most likely): the dev-warp pre-grant.** `WarpToRoom`/`WarpToLab` (the `[` / `]` test warps) set `HasShutter=true`. The student iterates on Frame 5 by warping there — so by the time they grab the pickup, `AcquireShutter` hit `if (HasShutter) return` and silently skipped the whole ceremony EVERY test.

**Fix:** removed the `HasShutter` early-out in `AcquireShutter` (the pickup is single-trigger via `_consumed`+Destroy, so it can only run once per pickup anyway). `ShutterPickupRoutine` now only calls `Unlock` when `!HasShutter`, so a warped run still plays the camera-raise + ingest beat (the lens-eye is already lit from the warp). Added two TEMP `Debug.Log` diagnostics (`AbilityPickup grabbed: <ability>` and `ShutterPickupRoutine ENTER — HasShutter=…`) to tell, next run, whether the new code runs at all (no logs ⇒ stale assembly) vs. a render issue. Offline runtime+editor `COMPILE OK`.

**Next:** student must let Unity recompile (focus editor / ⌘R, wait for the spinner, THEN ⌘P). Strip the TEMP logs once confirmed.

## Interaction 127 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Tuning — smoother impact shake + calmer exposure-switch jolt (Milestone 26.3)
**Current Goal:** Shake still a touch much / not smooth enough; the mode-switch camera "shake" is also too much.

### Student Prompt
(可以再平滑一点,抖动还是有点多,然后切模式的镜头抖动也多了点)

### Agent Response Summary
1. **Impact shake smoother + smaller** (`CameraFollow`): the "rough" feel was the HIGH noise frequency — dropped `ShakeFreq 26→15` so a hit reads as a smooth thud, not a buzzy rattle; trimmed amplitude `ShakeMaxOffset 0.14→0.10`, `ShakeMaxRoll 0.45→0.30`; faster settle `TraumaDecay 1.4→1.8` (~0.55s). Big-drop peak is now ~0.036u / 0.11°.
2. **Mode-switch "shake"** (`PostFXDirector`): diagnosed that the perceived camera shake on a switch was the **LensDistortion pinch** (geometric warp), not the camera tick (which at the new amplitude is ~0.1px, invisible). Cut the lens warp hard: `LensUnder −0.25→−0.08`, `LensOver 0.10→0.04`; reduced the camera tick `0.12→0.05`. Left the chromatic-aberration fringe (CA) as the photographic switch cue — it's colour, not motion.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/CameraFollow.cs` (ShakeFreq/amp/decay), `Core/PostFXDirector.cs` (LensUnder/LensOver + exposure-tick trauma).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: hits should read as a soft low thud that settles fast; switching 1/2/3 should feel calm — a faint colour fringe + bloom, almost no frame warp/shake. Knobs: `ShakeFreq`/`ShakeMaxOffset`/`ShakeMaxRoll`/`TraumaDecay`; switch warp = `LensUnder`/`LensOver`; switch fringe = `CAUnder/CANormal/CAOver`.)

## Interaction 125 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Game-feel redesign — Shutter pickup "she gathers the light" (Milestone 26.2)
**Current Goal:** The M26 lens-eye change was too subtle ("人物的变化不明显"). Student redirected: drop the eye, light up the DRESS / soft light, dreamy + atmospheric, "仔细设计".

### Student Prompt
(有了,但是人物的变化不明显 → 或者不做眼睛,让裙子亮起来或者出现一些柔光,这样梦幻有氛围感一点,仔细设计)

### Agent Response Summary
First nailed why the beat finally fired but read as nothing: it WAS firing, but the lens-eye glint was ~3px on a black silhouette — invisible. Also surfaced the real reason earlier runs showed nothing at all: `AcquireShutter` early-returned on `HasShutter`, and the student reaches Frame 5 by **dev-warp `]`** (pre-grants all abilities) → ceremony skipped every test. Removed that early-out (pickup is single-trigger anyway).
Redesigned the embodiment around the theme "the Shutter is the power to DRAW LIGHT, so light awakens IN her":
- **PlayerAnimator**: removed the lens-eye overlay; added a **dress inner-glow** = an additive (GlowMat) twin of the skirt sprite, child of the skirt GO so it swings with the hem; + a soft **Light2D pool** (`LightDirector.CreatePoint` on Lean, radius 2.6) she carries. Both dark until `AwakenGlow()`, which runs `GlowFlareRoutine` (overshoot bright as she lowers the camera, then settle). Update breathes both on a slow sine baseline (dress α 0.16–0.32, light 0.22–0.42). New API `AwakenGlow`/`ResetGlow`/`BodyWorldPos`/`SetGlowShown`, hooked into SetPose/ClearPose/SetVisible/PlayDevelopIn/DevelopRoutine so the glow hides whenever a baked pose (no separate skirt) is held.
- **GameManager**: `ShutterPickupRoutine` reworked — raise camera (PlayerShoot) → pickup light is drawn into her BODY (not eye) → ClearPose + `AwakenGlow()` + `LightBloom()`. New `LightBloom` coroutine = a soft halo ring that expands+fades (behind her, a backlight) + 12 gentle **motes** that rise, sway and fade over 1.5s (dreamy). Warm-pearl palette (`GlowTint` 1.00,0.93,0.78). Removed the TEMP diag logs.
Kept everything offline/baked — no new art; one runtime Light2D.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (dress-glow twin + body Light2D + AwakenGlow/ResetGlow/BodyWorldPos + breathing in Update; lens-eye removed), `Core/GameManager.cs` (ShutterPickupRoutine reworked + LightBloom halo/motes; warp/FullRestart renamed calls; diag log removed), `World/AbilityPickup.cs` (diag log removed).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`); grep confirms no dangling lens-eye refs.

### Student Follow-up
(pending verify: ⌘R → ⌘P, reach Frame 5, grab the shutter → she raises the camera, light is drawn into her, her DRESS kindles with a soft warm glow, a halo blooms and motes drift up; afterwards the dress breathes and she casts a soft light pool through the dark. Tunables: `GlowTint` + `GlowAlphaMin/Max` + `GlowLightMin/Max` + light radius 2.6 (PlayerAnimator); mote count/速度/颜色 + halo size + `LightBloom` dur + ingest dur (GameManager). Warm↔cool is a one-line palette swap. Reminder: don't test via warp `]` if you want the un-granted first-grab, though the beat now plays either way.)

## Interaction 128 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Bugfix — player always drew in front of the fog (Milestone 24.6)
**Current Goal:** The character appears to be permanently in front of the fog (VaporMotes); fog should be able to veil it.

### Student Prompt
(还有个问题是人物好像永远在雾前面)

### Agent Response Summary
Ran a multi-agent Workflow (8 agents: 4 parallel investigators → 1 diagnose → 3 adversarial verifiers) to nail the URP 2D draw-order cause and verify a fix before in-engine round-trips. Findings: player AND fog are both on the single "Default" sorting layer; the URP **2D Renderer** (ortho cam) sorts by sortingLayer→sortingOrder (NOT Z — the GraphicsSettings Z-axis is a red herring for the 2D path). Fog orders were {6,18,32,46,56}: only ONE layer (56) sat above the player (OrderPlayer 50), and that layer's alpha was 0.05 = near-invisible → the only fog over the player couldn't be seen, reading as "player always in front." The diagnose agent applied a fix (orders {6,18,32,54,62}, near-layer alphas raised to 0.12/0.10). Verifiers confirmed the sorting mechanism but caught a real defect: top order 62 > OrderForeground (60), so near fog would draw OVER the foreground framing band (wrong depth). Corrected 62 → 58 (still > player top sub-part lens-core 53, but < 60).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`World/VaporMotes.cs` — LSort {6,18,32,46,56} → {6,18,32,54,58}; LAlpha near layers 0.07/0.05 → 0.12/0.10. (Player & fog share the Default layer, so sortingOrder alone decides; no sorting-layer change needed.)

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: the two nearest fog wisps now drift IN FRONT of the character (veiling it) while the far three stay behind, and the foreground band still sits in front of the fog. Tunables: LSort near values (54/58) and LAlpha (0.12/0.10) for how heavily fog veils the player. If fog still never shows, the cause is upstream — Shader.Find("Darkroom/Fog") returning null. Next: ShadowCaster2D (W4) or Basinski decay (W6).)

## Interaction 126 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Game-feel — Shutter pickup becomes LIGHT PAINTING (Milestone 26.3)
**Current Goal:** The dress-glow/halo read too close to her existing aura ("和本来的光晕差不太多"). Student: make it more sophisticated — a faint light-PAINTING trail that turns into a solid trail when drawing.

### Student Prompt
(和本来的光晕差不太多,可以做的更有趣一点,想想怎么更高级,可以是像光绘那样会有个淡淡的轨迹,然后画画的时候变成实体的轨迹)

### Agent Response Summary
Found WHY the glow read as "same": `PlayerController.Create:59` already makes "the photographer's own faint glow" (a 0.35 Light2D pool she always carries) — my dress-glow + body-light just stacked more of the same. So I REMOVED all of M26.2's static glow (skirt-glow twin, halo ring, motes, body light) and replaced it with one structurally-new effect, deeply on-theme (the engine already calls DarkTrail "what a long exposure prints of a motion"):
- **New `LightPaintTrail`** (Player/, own file + hand-made .meta since the editor is open): two world-space LineRenderers (GlowMat line + BeamMat soft beam — the SAME vocabulary as TrailStroke). Once `GameManager.HasShutter`, it samples her feet into a rolling ~0.7s buffer and renders a faint warm streak (GhostAlpha 0.20) that fades head→tail; teleport-guard clears it across respawn/warp; no motion → no trail (true long-exposure). While actually DRAWING (Under/Over + Shift + moving) it brightens (DrawAlpha 0.70) and takes the stroke's colour (`ColorFor` DarkStroke 0x9FD8E6 / BrightStroke 0xFFF3D6), rendering just under the real solid stroke (OrderStroke-2) — so the ghost she leaves in passing visibly hardens into the standable stroke. `Ignite()` gives a ~1.3s bright sweep on first acquire. Wired in `PlayerController.Create`.
- **PlayerAnimator**: stripped all M26.2 glow machinery (fields, skirt-glow build, body light, AwakenGlow/ResetGlow/SetGlowShown/GlowFlareRoutine, breathing, the Light2D using); kept only `BodyLocal`/`BodyWorldPos` (ingest target).
- **GameManager**: pickup beat now camera-raise → ingest into her body → ClearPose + spark + `LightPaintTrail.Ignite()` (removed the halo/motes `LightBloom`). Warps Ignite; FullRestart just ClearPose (trail auto-off via HasShutter=false).

Kept the existing always-on player glow (line 59) untouched — that was the "本来的光晕".

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/LightPaintTrail.cs` (NEW + .meta), `Player/PlayerController.cs` (AddComponent+Init), `Player/PlayerAnimator.cs` (glow machinery removed), `Core/GameManager.cs` (pickup beat → trail ignite; LightBloom + AwakenGlow/ResetGlow calls removed).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`); grep confirms no dangling glow refs; new script has a minimal .meta (editor is open).

### Student Follow-up
(pending verify: ⌘R → ⌘P, PLAY to Frame 5 — grab shutter → camera raise + spark, then her first steps paint a vivid light streak that settles to a faint ghost as she moves; hold Shift in Under/Over to draw → the trail brightens to the stroke colour and the solid stroke sets just under it. Tunables in `LightPaintTrail`: GhostAlpha/DrawAlpha, Life 0.7s, Width 0.085, GhostTint, FootDrop (set =0.25 to sit exactly on the draw line), Spacing. Reminder: don't warp `]` to test the un-granted first grab — though the beat plays either way now.)

### Follow-up (Interaction 126.1) — mode-coloured trail + timing

**Student:** "过了序章第一关就有了,而且应该随mode变化,比如under是冷色".

**Timing:** verified — the trail is gated `gm.HasShutter && !gm.HasWon`, and Bootstrap only `GrantNegativeSilently` (no early Shutter); all HasShutter grants are the Frame-5 pickup + the two dev-warps. So a straight playthrough shows the trail only after Frame 5. Seeing it in Frame 1 = dev-warp `[`/`]` pre-granting all abilities (the documented [[darkroom-devwarp-pregrants]] gotcha). No code change to gating; explained to student.

**Mode colour:** `LightPaintTrail` colour now follows `ExposureManager.Current` at ALL times (not only while drawing): Under → `DarkStroke` cool (0x9FD8E6), Over → `BrightStroke` warm (0xFFF3D6), Normal → faint neutral `GhostTint` at half alpha. Drawing still brightens to `DrawAlpha`. Added eased `_curTint`/`_curHead` (lerp ~9–10/s) so a mode switch glides instead of snapping. Offline `COMPILE OK`.

**Next:** student to PLAY (not warp) to confirm timing, and check Under=cool / Over=warm / Normal=faint. Tunable: Normal alpha (GhostAlpha*0.5), ease speeds.

## Interaction 129 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Asset swap — new background music track (Milestone 24.7)
**Current Goal:** Replace the existing background music with a new track ("Darkroom Flicker") the student put in ~/Downloads.

### Student Prompt
(我在downloads 里面放了一首新的bgm,Darkroom Flicker,替换现有的背景音乐)

### Agent Response Summary
`AudioDirector.LoadMusic()` loads the FIRST audio file (.ogg/.wav/.mp3) found in `StreamingAssets/music` and loops it — no filename is hard-coded, so swapping is a pure asset op, no code change. To REPLACE (not add): copied `~/Downloads/Darkroom Flicker.mp3` into `Assets/StreamingAssets/music/`, hand-made its `.mp3.meta` by cloning the existing DefaultImporter meta with a fresh guid (c1196f7a…), and DELETED the old `Red Safelight Prints.mp3` + its meta so exactly one music file remains (keeps the "first file" pick unambiguous). The per-exposure music low-pass (Under 900Hz / Normal 5000 / Over 22000) and the "music joins at Frame 1" fade now apply to the new track automatically.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Assets/StreamingAssets/music/` — added `Darkroom Flicker.mp3` (+meta), removed `Red Safelight Prints.mp3` (+meta). No script changes.

### Immediate Result
File swap complete; one track present. (No compile needed — assets only.)

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R (Assets→Refresh so Unity imports the new mp3) → ⌘P: the new track should loop from Frame 1, muffling in Under / opening up in Over via the existing low-pass. If it doesn't play, check the Console for "[AudioDirector] music load failed" — MPEG import or a corrupt file. To change volume: AudioDirector.MusicVolume (0.20).)

### Follow-up fix (Interaction 126.2) — Frame 4 rise-lift pinches the player

**Student:** Frame 4 (Contact Sheet) 电梯会和升上去的平台左边重合,容易卡住;让电梯右边缘和平台左边对齐.

**Geometry:** `R4_Floor` cx47 w10 → [42,52]; `R4_HighLedge` cx56 w5 → [53.5,58.5]; `R4_RiseLift` was cx53 w2 → [52,54]. Left edge already flush with the floor (52), but the right edge (54) overlapped the ledge by 0.5 ([53.5,54]); at the top of the ride the player got pinched between the rising lift and the ledge's left edge. The floor→ledge gap is only 1.5 wide but the lift was 2 wide, so it HAD to overlap one side.

**Fix:** sized the lift to fill the gap exactly — `RiseDef("R4_RiseLift", 52.75f, 8.7f, 3.2f, 1.5f, 0.6f)` → spans [52, 53.5]: left flush with floor right edge, right flush with HighLedge left edge. Zero overlap on either side at any height; only the right edge moved in (54→53.5), the good left-flush is preserved. Offline `COMPILE OK`.

**Next:** ⌘R → ⌘P, Frame 4, OVER to summon the lift and ride to the ledge — should step off cleanly with no snag.

### Follow-up (Interaction 126.3) — R1 trail bridge: walk-on snag + refined look

**Student:** the pre-drawn trail bridge after the prologue (R1) 有概率走不上去得跳; and 画好的轨迹设计不够高级,精致一点.

**Walk-on snag (collision):** `R1_SeeTrail` started/ended exactly at the floor/landing tops (10.5,0.5)/(18.0,0.5). The `DarkTrail` EdgeCollider2D has edgeRadius 0.07, so the streak SURFACE sat at point.y+0.07 ≈ 0.57 vs the floor top 0.5 → a 0.07 lip that intermittently blocked walking. Fix (LevelData): dropped the endpoints by the edgeRadius (0.5→0.43, surface now flush at 0.5) and added a short flat lead-in/out that OVERLAPS the floor/landing — points now `(10.0,0.43)(10.5,0.43) … (18.0,0.43)(18.5,0.43)`. Seamless hand-off both ends; bow apex 1.5 (lost frame at 2.6 still clears).

**Refined look (DarkTrail rewrite):** was a single GlowMat line + one BeamMat glow. Now: (1) render along a **Chaikin** corner-cut curve (2 iters) — silky, and it stays inside the control hull so the glow never bulges below the bridged ground; (2) **three luminous layers** — bright near-white core (GlowMat, DarkStroke→white 0.40), soft beam (BeamMat ×5, α0.50), broad halo (BeamMat ×11, α0.22); (3) a **soft bloom** anchoring each endpoint where it meets the ground (SoftGlow, α0.45); (4) a gentle **breathing** (±12

COLLISION stays on the authored control points (flush seams preserved); all layers gated by the UNDER matrix alpha via the existing ExposureObject contract. Applies to every DarkTrail (R1 + lab demo).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelData.cs` (R1_SeeTrail points -> flush+overlap), `World/DarkTrail.cs` (layered/smoothed/breathing rewrite; collider unchanged on control points).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(pending verify: walk R1 in UNDER with no jump/snag; trail reads as a silky layered glowing curve with bloomed ends + faint breath. Could propagate the look to the player TrailStroke / LightBridge for consistency. Tunables: layer widths/alphas, bloom scale 0.7, breath amp, CoreCol white-mix 0.40.)

## Interaction 130 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Prologue exit — auto-walk INTO the door before the develop-in (Milestone 27)
**Current Goal:** Make the prologue exit natural: she walks NEAR the door, then auto-walks INTO it (no input), flowing into the existing "develops in the glowing photo" cinematic.

### Student Prompt
(序章那里做成人物走到门附近,然后不用操作人物会自动走到门里,然后接那个现有的人物在发光相片里的动画,这样自然一点)

### Agent Response Summary
The old `PrologueExitRoutine` **zeroed velocity + froze into the idle pose the instant the door trigger fired** (`LevelExit.IsPrologueDoor` → `BeginPrologueExit(doorPos)`) — an abrupt freeze-on-contact. Added a scripted walk-in beat:
- **`PlayerController.ScriptedMoveX`** (new public float): used in the `!InputEnabled` branch as `_moveX = ScriptedMoveX` (was hard `0`). Default 0 → every other input-off freeze (respawn/finale) is unchanged; non-zero drives the normal ground ramp + walk animation, so the cutscene walk is the real walk (footsteps, lean, skirt/hair all live).
- **`PrologueExitRoutine`** restructured: no longer zeroes velocity up front. Sets `ScriptedMoveX = 0.55` (calm ~3.85 u/s) and walks until `player.x ≥ doorX + 0.2` (a step into the doorway) with a 1.6s safety guard, THEN stops, `SetPose(idle)`, 0.35s settle, and the existing paper-develop reveal runs unchanged (the scrim covers her as she "enters"). Geometry: room 0 exit `(-6,4.4)` on `R0_FarGround` (x −9…−5, top 2.8); trigger fires ~x −6.95, so she strolls ~1.15u into the door. Trigger geometry untouched (avoids level-sensitivity / stale-scene risk).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/PlayerController.cs` (ScriptedMoveX field + `!InputEnabled` branch), `Core/GameManager.cs` (`PrologueExitRoutine` walk-in beat).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, replay the prologue: climb the UNDER steps to the high ledge, walk toward the blank-paper door — on contact control hands off and she keeps walking INTO the doorway (live walk anim), settles, then the paper + blank silhouette develop and the title drops as before. Tunables in `PrologueExitRoutine`: walk speed `ScriptedMoveX 0.55`, stop point `doorX + 0.2`, settle `0.35s`. If the walk feels too short, widen the prologue trigger LEFT in `LevelBuilder` r==0 (stay within the −9…−5 ledge so it can't fire mid-climb).)

### Follow-up (Interaction 126.4) — player TrailStroke gets the refined look + corner-hotspot fix

**Student:** make the players own drawn stroke use the DarkTrail quality; sharp drawn corners show an incongruous glow hotspot (screenshot).

**Cause:** `TrailStroke` was only 2 layers (GlowMat line + one BeamMat glow) drawn on the RAW points, so at a sharp drawn corner the wide (x5) additive beam folded over itself → a bright blob.

**Fix / refinement (TrailStroke):** render now mirrors DarkTrail — (1) the three line renderers draw along a `DarkTrail.Chaikin(_pts,1)` smoothed curve (1 iter, endpoints exact), so sharp corners round off and the beam stops bunching; (2) added the broad halo layer (BeamMat x11, a0.22) behind the beam (now a0.50) and brightened the core toward white (ColorFor->white 0.40); (3) soft end blooms (SoftGlow a0.45) anchoring pen-down/pen-up, riding the pen while drawing. The matrix `OnAlphaApplied` now fades glow+halo+blooms+light together (core stays steady, as before). `DarkTrail.Chaikin` made `internal static` and reused. DespawnRoutine blink routed through a `SetRenderEnabled` helper (covers all layers).

**Deliberately NOT changed:** the EdgeCollider2D + jam/distance still use the RAW `_pts`, so the platform you stand on is exactly what you drew (no gameplay shift). Tradeoff: at a VERY sharp self-drawn peak the smoothed render rounds a hair below the raw apex — minor; can also smooth the collider (Chaikin keeps endpoints so span/reach is preserved) if the float ever shows.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/TrailStroke.cs` (halo + blooms + Chaikin-smoothed render + brighter core; collider unchanged), `World/DarkTrail.cs` (Chaikin -> internal static for reuse).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(verify: draw a stroke with a sharp corner in Under/Over — corner glow should be smooth now, and the stroke should read like the R1 bridge: layered, silky, bloomed ends. Now consistent across DarkTrail + player TrailStroke; LightBridge still on the old look if they want it matched too. Tunables: Chaikin iters (1->2 = silkier but more peak-rounding), halo width/alpha, bloom scale 0.6.)

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Prologue polish — clear the lingering exposure card before the reveal (Milestone 27.1)
**Current Goal:** The exposure mode-hint card (shown on a switch) can still be on screen when the giant-paper / silhouette-develop / flash cinematic starts — clean it up.

### Student Prompt
(巨幅相纸 + 空白剪影显影 + 闪光那会儿上面的 mode 提示卡还在,影响观感 — 切模式后那个当前模式提示卡有 hold+淡出,会拖进过场)

### Agent Response Summary
`ShowCard` already bails when `gm.IsCinematic`, but a card whose `CardRoutine` (fade-in → hold → fade-out) is ALREADY running keeps animating into the cinematic — so a switch shortly before the door leaves the "NORMAL / Stable and readable" card floating over the paper reveal. The chrome block in `HUDController.Update` (line ~882, which already fades `_sliderCg`/`_topCg` to `_chromeAlpha` on `IsCinematic||HasWon`) now ALSO, when a cinematic/win is active and the card is still active: stops `_cardCo` and `MoveTowards`-fades `_cardGroup.alpha→0` at the same 4/s rate, deactivating it at ~0. So the card clears WITH the chrome (~0.25s) the instant the cinematic begins, well before the develop-in beat.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` — chrome-fade block: cancel + fade the exposure card on `IsCinematic || HasWon`.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: switch a mode just before the prologue door, then walk in — the mode card should fade out within ~0.25s as the chrome goes, leaving the paper reveal clean. Same now covers the finale + win. Rate knob = the `Time.deltaTime * 4f` shared with the chrome fade.)

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** OVER burn-through redesign — irregular multi-point burn + ash aftermath (Milestone 24.8)
**Current Goal:** The burn-through was a stiff single circular hole in the centre; the post-burn dark-rectangle "ghost" looked weird. Make burning irregular / from multiple points, and replace the ghost with ashes.

### Student Prompt
(现有的over烧穿墙壁太呆板,就是中间一个圆形的洞,真实的灼烧应该是不规则的,从多个地方烧掉的。而且烧掉之后现在有个残影也有点怪,可以做点灰烬啥的)

### Agent Response Summary
Ran a 7-agent design-panel Workflow (3 divergent burn designs → synthesize → 3 adversarial verifiers) since this is a creative visual with costly in-engine round-trips. Synthesis (best of three) was applied + then hardened by the verifiers:
- **Irregular scar sprite**: replaced the single radial-disc `ProcGfx.CharScar` with `CharScar(int v)` / `CharRim(int v)` — 6 cached variants, each a 3-4 lobe scorch with FBM-ragged edges (value-noise coastline around each lobe, darkest-wins union) + warm amber ember rim. NOT a clean circle.
- **Multi-point burn that MERGES**: `BurnWall` scatters 5 ragged scars with staggered ignition thresholds; they light one-by-one and grow. **Verifier [looks-right] caught (via a standalone coverage sim) that the original scatter only covered ~23% of the narrow-tall 0.6×3 walls the game actually uses** → looked like pelts on white paper. Fixes applied: oversize blobs (lobeFit ×0.85→×1.5, since dark fill is ~60% of the sprite) and **chain the spots evenly along the LONG axis (+jitter), hugging the short-axis centre** so neighbours overlap into one continuous ragged hole.
- **Aftermath (no ghost)**: deleted the dark-rectangle remnant; the paper now **chars + fades to ~0.12 alpha as it's consumed** (brown char, not a bright-orange glowing rectangle — also a verifier fix), leaving a **chain of ragged `CharRim` outlines** tracing the whole opening, plus a one-shot self-destructing `AshBurst` (14 falling/tumbling ash flakes + 6 rising embers that cool amber→soot) and a warm `StrokeSparkle.Burst` at punch-through. A live ember/ash trickle plays during the burn; per-spot independent ember flicker.

### Verifier verdicts
guardrails-gameplay → PASS (no red; amber embers only; collider still permanently disabled; particles self-destruct; sorts below OrderForeground). compiles → the burn code is API-clean & -warnaserror clean (the verifier's transient red was an UNRELATED concurrent edit to Player/TrailStroke.cs by the parallel session — since resolved). looks-right → needs-change fixes (coverage + paper-fade) all applied.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/ProcGfx.cs` (CharScar(int)/CharRim(int) + FBM lobe rasteriser; removed the old disc property), `Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (BurnWall: 5 chained staggered scars + per-spot rim + trickle), `World/BurnPaper.cs` (paper chars+fades as consumed; AshBurst + sparkle aftermath, ghost removed), NEW `World/AshBurst.cs` (+ hand-made .meta) — one-shot ash/ember emitter.

### Immediate Result
Full-tree offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, Frame with a white wall, hold OVER nearby: fire should start at several spots, eat in with ragged edges, and merge into ONE irregular hole as the sheet chars and fades — then ash flakes drift down + embers rise/cool, leaving a singed ragged rim, no ghost rectangle. Tunables: SPOTS / lobeFit ×1.5 / chain spread 0.8 in BurnWall; paper char colour + fade `Lerp(1,0.12,k²)` in BurnPaper; ash/ember counts in AshBurst. CharScar variant count = 6 in ProcGfx.)

## Interaction 133 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Prologue polish v2 — clear the REAL lingering hint + softer camera breath (Milestone 27.2)
**Current Goal:** The 131 card fix didn't fix it; find the actual lingering "2-normal" UI in the prologue cinematic. Also the camera up/down breath is still a touch much.

### Student Prompt
(好像还是没修好,然后镜头上下的抖动还是有点多,再调小一点)

### Agent Response Summary
**131 misdiagnosis corrected.** `ShowCard` early-returns in the prologue (`if (!gm.HasFlash) return` — Flash isn't acquired until R2), so the exposure CARD never shows there; 131 targeted the wrong element. The real lingering UI is the prologue **key-hint** `KeyHintRoutine` — a standalone `NewText` on `CanvasRoot` at top-centre `(0,-118)` reading "1 — safelight" / "2 — work light" (= the "2-normal" the student saw), long life (0.3s in → 2.2s hold → 0.6s out). The prologue design has you press 2 (work light) to confirm the real ground right by the door, so it floats into the paper reveal — and it sits OUTSIDE every chrome CanvasGroup, so neither the chrome fade nor the 131 card-clear touched it. Fix: track the active hint (`_keyHint` Text + `_keyHintCo`); `ShowKeyHint` cancels/destroys any prior; the chrome block now fades `_keyHint.color.a→0` (same 4/s as chrome) + destroys it on `IsCinematic||HasWon`. Kept the 131 card-clear (still valid for later cinematics where the card can show). **Camera breath:** `CameraFollow.BreatheAmp 0.022→0.011`, `BreatheFreq 0.10→0.09` (≈half the vertical drift).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (`_keyHint`/`_keyHintCo` tracking + cinematic clear in the chrome block), `Core/CameraFollow.cs` (BreatheAmp/Freq).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P — let Unity recompile first or it runs the stale assembly. Prologue: press 2 (work light) by the door, walk in → the "2 — work light" note should fade out as the cinematic starts, paper reveal clean. Idle camera up/down breath is ~half. Knobs: hint fade rate `4f`; breath `BreatheAmp 0.011`.)

### Follow-up (Interaction 126.5) — player stroke corner still "explodes" at the pen-up

**Student:** the turn still looks like it bursts (screenshot: a flower/star blob where the drawn stroke hooks and ends in mid-air).

**Cause:** confirmed it is NOT StrokeSparkle (those are round + short-lived). It was the 126.4 additions concentrating at the stroke END, which here lands on a sharp mid-air hook: (a) the endpoint bloom (SoftGlow 0.6 a0.45) sitting right there, (b) the very wide halo x11 (1.54u) whose rounded END-CAP is a big bright disc, (c) the fat 0.7 end-taper. DarkTrail blooms read fine only because its ends rest flush on the ground.

**Fix (TrailStroke only; DarkTrail unchanged):** (1) removed the endpoint blooms — StrokeSparkle already juices the ends, and the bloom was the clearest offender; (2) halo x11 -> x7 so a hairpin folds less; (3) sharpened the shared end-taper 0.7 -> 0.25 so every stroke (and the live pen tip) eases to a FINE POINT instead of a fat glowing cap. Net: a mid-air pen-up now closes to a tip, no disc/bloom. Kept the Chaikin-smoothed render + brighter core + layered glow.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Player/TrailStroke.cs` (blooms removed; halo x11->x7; end-taper 0.7->0.25). DarkTrail untouched.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`); grep confirms the only remaining bloom refs are DarkTrail (intended).

### Student Follow-up
(verify: draw a stroke that hooks / ends in mid-air — the end should taper to a clean point with no burst. If a brief puff still shows the MOMENT you finish, that is the transient StrokeSparkle.Burst (5/endpoint, fades <0.45s) + FixFlash glow swell — can trim those next if wanted. Tunables: taper end 0.25, halo x7.)

## Interaction 134 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Teaching aid — per-frame control-hint highlight (Milestone 28)
**Current Goal:** When a frame leans on a specific op (e.g. SHIFT-draw), make the matching top-right control hint highlight, elegantly, so the player reads what to do.

### Student Prompt
(这一关需要什么操作的时候,比如shift 画轨迹,就让右上角对应的操作提示 UI 高亮起来,便于理解操作,但也要做得优雅)

### Agent Response Summary
The top-right controls were ONE multi-line `_controlsText` (mono, dim, in `_controlsGroup` @0.55, conditional lines: move · `1/2/3 exposure` if Flash · `hold SHIFT draw` if Shutter · `ESC/R`; whole block fades at x>73). Rather than refactor into per-line objects, drove the same single Text through a tiny line-list and pulse the featured line via RICH-TEXT colour (efficient, no layout change):
- `RebuildControls` now feeds `AddCtrl(kind, text)` (kinds Move/Exposure/Draw/System) then `ApplyControlsText()`.
- `ApplyControlsText` composes the string, wrapping the line whose kind == `_ctrlHighlight` in `<color=#hex>` where hex is a slow warm pulse `Lerp((0.78,0.72,0.50),(1,0.93,0.72), 0.5+0.5·sin(t·3))`. Re-applied each frame in Update while highlighted + `!_controlsGone`.
- `FeaturedControl(room)` map (editable): R2-4 → Exposure, R5 → Draw, else None. `HighlightControl(FeaturedControl(room))` fires on frame entry.
- Elegant timing emerges for free: the exposure/draw LINES only exist once Flash/Shutter is owned, so the pulse appears exactly when the op becomes usable (enter R2 → no line yet → pick up Flash → exposure line appears already pulsing; same for Shutter/draw in R5). No highlight in the prologue (move/jump only) or after the controls retire (x>73).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` — ControlHint enum + line-list (`_ctrlTexts`/`_ctrlKinds`/`_ctrlCount`/`_ctrlHighlight`); `RebuildControls`/`AddCtrl`/`ApplyControlsText`/`FeaturedControl`/`HighlightControl`; per-frame pulse + per-room trigger in Update.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`, full tree 0 errors).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: R2 pick up the Flash → "1/2/3 · Q/E exposure" pulses warm; R5 pick up the Shutter → "hold SHIFT draw · release fix" pulses. Edit which frame highlights what in `FeaturedControl(room)`. Knobs: pulse colour/speed in `ApplyControlsText` (the two warm colours + `·3` rate). If too subtle under the 0.55 group alpha, brighten the warm or bump `_controlsGroup.alpha` while highlighted. Controls (and the highlight) still fade after R5/x>73.)

## Interaction 135 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Bugfix — faint square behind each burn scar (Milestone 24.8.1)
**Current Goal:** While burning, each scar shows a faint background SQUARE — breaks immersion.

### Student Prompt
(烧的那个效果能看到每一个烧有个淡淡的背景正方形,有点出戏)

### Agent Response Summary
Root cause in `ProcGfx.BuildCharScar`: after rasterising the ragged scorch shape (transparent outside it), it called `cv.Grain(0,0,N,N,…,0.28f)` — Grain paints over the WHOLE 64×64 rect and OVERWRITES ~28% of pixels with semi-opaque charcoal regardless of the shape, so the transparent background became a faint speckled square (visible as a square behind every one of the 5 scar quads). Fixed by replacing the full-rect Grain with a MASKED speckle loop that only touches pixels already inside the scorch (alpha != 0) and keeps their existing alpha (so the soot stays solid, no see-through holes, and the background stays fully clear). `BuildCharRim` already self-masks (hollows to an edge band, clears the rest), so it was fine.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/ProcGfx.cs` — BuildCharScar: full-rect `Grain` → in-shape masked speckle.

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P, burn a wall: each scar should now be a clean ragged scorch with NO faint square around it. If any faint rectangle remains, it'd be a different layer — say so and I'll hunt it.)

## Interaction 127 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** HUD polish — glass bar depth, top-left layout, trails relocation (Milestone 27)
**Current Goal:** exposure bar glass looks cheap (light/shadow layering); top-left title/objectives spacing; move the Trail budget to bottom-centre; make the UI prettier.

### Student Prompt
(这个bar 的玻璃质感还是比较廉价,尤其是光影层次。左上角 UI 的间距和布局也调一调,Trail 的可用数量放在屏幕底部中间,UI 做的漂亮一点)

### Agent Response Summary
All in `HUDController`, using existing PixelArt sprites (RoundedRect/Disc/SoftGlow/GlassBar) + the refraction RawImage.
- **Glass rod (`BuildExposureSlider`):** was one flat 16px bar. Rebuilt as a layered rod (h16->22): (1) soft SoftGlow drop shadow, (2) glass body = refraction RawImage or baked GlassBar with a faint cool cast, (3) a RoundedRect underside shade, (4) a crisp RoundedRect top highlight line, (5) a soft OFF-CENTRE SoftGlow glint (the real-glass cue — one bloom, not uniform shine), (6) two cap sparkles at the rounded ends. Layered child order = back-to-front depth.
- **Knob:** added a SoftGlow cast shadow + a dark rim disc under the bright disc + spec → reads as a lit bead with depth.
- **Top-left (`BuildRoomInfo`):** title 38 cursive nudged to (52,-40); objectives moved to (54,-100) with a faint warm vertical MARGIN RULE down the left and the list indented past it (title/rule/list share one left edge); line gap 28->30; objective text a touch brighter (0.62->0.66).
- **Trails budget (`BuildTrailsGroup`):** moved from top-right (310,-118) to BOTTOM-CENTRE (anchor 0.5,0 @ y30); three ROUND Disc pips in a centred row above a small letter-spaced "T R A I L S" caption; placed low enough to clear the tutorial card (bottom-centre, y70-220, gone by Frame 5+ when trails unlock). SetStrokeDots/PunchTrails unchanged.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (BuildExposureSlider glass rod + knob depth; BuildRoomInfo spacing + margin rule; BuildTrailsGroup -> bottom-centre round pips).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(verify: bar should read as a lit glass rod (shadow under, bright top line, one off-centre glint, sparkly caps) with a beaded knob; top-left title+checklist aligned to one margin with a faint rule; Trail pips a clean round trio bottom-centre. Tunables: glint pos/size + hiLine alpha (glass), rule alpha 0.26 + indent 16 (layout), pip spacing 22 / y30 (trails).)

## Interaction 136 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-25
**Development Stage:** Burn variety — each wall burns at different positions (Milestone 24.8.2)
**Current Goal:** Make each wall's burn-through location differ, so it feels random/natural (after the soot-smudge remnant was approved "非常好").

### Student Prompt
(非常好!然后我想让每堵墙被烧的位置不太一样,这样随机自然一些)

### Agent Response Summary
The seed was already per-wall (from c.x/c.y), but the STRUCTURE was too regular — a fixed 5 evenly-spaced spots — so walls looked alike. Broke the regularity (now safe to scatter freely because the paper already chars+fades as it burns, so holes no longer must tile the wall): spot COUNT now 4-6 per wall (rng.Next); the whole cluster gets a random along-axis shift (chainShift ±20% of the long side) so the opening isn't always centred; each spot's SIZE varies (0.8-1.35× lobeFit); along-jitter 0.12→0.2 and across-spread 0.25→0.34. All still derived from the position seed → stable per wall across rebuilds, distinct between walls. Changed `const int SPOTS = 5` → `int SPOTS = 4 + rng.Next(0,3)` (closures capture it; arrays/loops/trickle all use the variable).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Level/LevelBuilder.cs` (BurnWall: variable SPOTS, chainShift, per-spot spotFit, larger jitter/spread).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(⌘R → ⌘P: burn several walls — count/size/position should visibly differ wall-to-wall, identical on replay of the same wall. Tunables: SPOTS range; chainShift 0.2; spotFit 0.8+0.55; along/across 0.2/0.34.)

### Follow-up (Interaction 127.1) — UI spacing nudges

Student fixed the ProcGfx CS0103 themselves (their in-progress soot/char edit — brace scope). Then two micro-tweaks: TRAILS label→pips gap opened (pip y 30->36, group h 48->54) and the top-left objectives dropped further below the title (objRT y -100 -> -110). Offline `COMPILE OK`.

### Follow-up (Interaction 127.2) — margin rule length + glass rounder/blended

**Student:** the warm margin rule is sometimes two rows long when there is only one objective — keep it consistent; make the glass bar corners rounder/softer; and blend it into the background better.

1. **Margin rule:** stored the rule as `_objRule`; in the room-info setter it now resizes to the live objective count — height 26 for 1 objective, 56 for 2, disabled for 0. No more two-line rule under a one-line list.
2. **Rounder + blend (glass body):** the shader `Darkroom/GlassRefract` exists, so the body was the REFRACTION RawImage — a rectangular screen-grab → hard corners + a frosted-panel look pasted over the scene. Swapped it for the baked `GlassBar` CAPSULE (rounded stadium ends) tinted cool; its baked body alpha (~0.10) is near-transparent so the scene reads THROUGH the rod = it sits in the frame. Softened the top highlight (0.5->0.40) and the off-centre glint (0.55->0.42) so it reads as lit glass, not a bright bar.

**Orphaned:** `GlassRefraction` is now unused (slider was its only consumer) but Bootstrap still adds it and it does a per-frame ScreenCapture grab. Left in place (reversible if the student preferred the refraction look — could round-mask it instead); flagged to the student to remove for perf or keep.

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`UI/HUDController.cs` (_objRule field + per-room resize; glass body -> GlassBar capsule, softer highlight/glint).

### Immediate Result
Offline runtime `COMPILE OK` (`-warnaserror`).

### Student Follow-up
(verify: a one-objective frame shows a one-line rule; the exposure bar is a rounded translucent glass rod you can see the scene through. Decide on the orphaned GlassRefraction manager. Tunables: rule heights 26/56; body tint/alpha; highlight 0.40 / glint 0.42.)

## Interaction 128 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:** 2026-06-26
**Development Stage:** WebGL readiness — StreamingAssets loading + orphan cleanup (Milestone 28)
**Current Goal:** make the game exportable as a WebGL page-embed. The blocker: art/music loaded via sync File/Directory APIs, which do not exist on WebGL (no filesystem, network is async-only).

### Student Prompt
(想导出成 Webpage-based game 插入网页 → 好的,开始)

### Agent Response Summary
Made StreamingAssets loading WebGL-safe without disturbing desktop:
- **manifest.txt** (new, in StreamingAssets) — a shipped file list, because WebGL cannot enumerate a remote directory. Lists every art/*.png + root *.jpg + music/*.mp3.
- **PixelArt**: `LoadExternal` platform-split — WebGL decodes from a byte cache, desktop keeps File.ReadAllBytes. New `PreloadWebAssets()` coroutine (WebGL) fetches manifest + every non-music file via UnityWebRequest into the cache at boot. New `EnumerateArt(pattern)` — WebGL filters the manifest, desktop lists the dir; `BackdropScenes`/`MidgroundClutter`/`GlobArt` all routed through it (also de-duplicated three copies of the glob loop). `WebManifest` exposed for audio.
- **Bootstrap**: split `Boot` → `BuildWorld`; on WebGL a tiny `BootPreloader` MonoBehaviour runs `PreloadThenBuild` (yield preload, then build) so the synchronous art getters find their bytes; desktop builds immediately. **Removed the orphaned `GlassRefraction` manager** (unused since the slider went to the GlassBar capsule; it was doing a per-frame ScreenCapture grab — bad on WebGL).
- **AudioDirector.LoadMusic**: platform-split discovery — WebGL picks the first `music/*` from `WebManifest` and builds the URL (space→%20); desktop keeps Directory.GetFiles. Shared async UnityWebRequestMultimedia load.
- **DarkroomManifest.cs** (new Editor tool) — menu `Darkroom ▸ Regenerate StreamingAssets Manifest` rewrites manifest.txt from the folder (run after adding art). New-file metas hand-made (editor open). Namespace `Darkroom` (not `Darkroom.EditorTools` — that name is a class in DarkroomValidator; collision fixed).

### Files / Mechanics Changed
`Core/PixelArt.cs`, `Core/Bootstrap.cs`, `Core/AudioDirector.cs`, new `Editor/DarkroomManifest.cs` (+meta), new `StreamingAssets/manifest.txt` (+meta). GlassRefraction.cs now dead code (kept, not instantiated).

### Immediate Result
Offline `COMPILE OK` on THREE passes: desktop (`#else`), `-define:UNITY_WEBGL` (the WebGL branches), and Editor (`-define:UNITY_EDITOR`). All `-warnaserror`.

### Student Follow-up
(next = the student builds in Unity: install WebGL module, switch platform, Player Settings Brotli + Decompression Fallback + Linear, add Level01 to Scenes in Build, Build; then iframe-embed. If art is added later, run the Regenerate Manifest menu first. Can I not run the actual WebGL build headless here — student does it in the Editor.)

### Follow-up (Interaction 128.1) — web embed: scrollbars + boot blue-screen

**Student:** the deployed embed shows bottom/right scrollbars in Chrome AND Safari, and the first load shows a blue screen for a while.

**Scrollbars (no rebuild needed):** the stock Unity template renders a FIXED 960x600 canvas (`width=960 height=600` + `canvas.style.width="960px"` in the desktop branch) plus a footer bar — that overflows the host iframe on both axes. Patched the deployed `works-embeds/the-darkroom/index.html` (and mirrored to `Darkroom1.0/index.html`): CSS override fills the iframe viewport (html/body 100%, overflow hidden, near-black letterbox #0a0a0c; container inset:0; canvas 100%), footer reduced to a quiet fullscreen button overlay (logo/title hidden), desktop JS branch now sets canvas style to 100%. Engine keeps the render target matched to DOM size x dpr, so it stays crisp. Pushed to Port repo (89c363e).

**Blue screen (needs rebuild):** the M28 WebGL preload runs BEFORE BuildWorld, but the real clear colour is only set in SetupCamera (inside BuildWorld) — so the template camera's default sky-blue clear filled the canvas for the whole StreamingAssets fetch. Fix in `Bootstrap.Boot` (WebGL branch): paint `Camera.main` SolidColor + `VisualFactory.Background` near-black immediately, before starting the preloader. Offline `COMPILE OK` (desktop + `-define:UNITY_WEBGL`).

**Next:** student rebuilds in Unity (same Darkroom1.0 output); then only `Build/*` needs re-copying to the site (the deployed index.html keeps the embed-fit patch — a rebuild regenerates the stock template index.html, do NOT copy it over).
